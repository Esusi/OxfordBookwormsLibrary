# A01 Love or Money?

​	Are you a good detective? Yes? If you are,then you must find the killer before Inspector Walsh. Inspector Walsh is a police detective; he works slowly,but very carefully. Are you quicker?

​	What does a detective do? A detective looks for clues. A clue is something,big or small ,that tells who the killer is. Clues are not esay to find,but there are many clues in this story. Some clues are good- they help you. Other clues are bad - they stop you finding the killer. You must read carefully, or you will miss the clues.

​	But remember: you must not believe everything that people say. The killer will obviously lie. Perhaps other people will also lie, for different reasons. And perhaps they want someone to die. But who wants… and kills?Can you find the killer?
