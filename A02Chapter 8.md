# Chapter 8

​	Elizabeth didn't give me  her army. She put me in prison. You know this, James it is the story of your life, not mine. I was twenty-five years old when I came to England, and I am forty-five now, Twenty years in England prisons.

​	Moray told lies about me. Mary and Bothwell killed Darnley, he said. Mary slept with Riccio and Bothwell and killed her husband. But it's not true! They're all lies, James—wicked lies! They only said these things because I am a woman, and a Catholic, and they don't want ca Catholic queen in Scotland, they want a Protestant king.

​	A king like you, James. Why, James my son, don't you help me? Why are you friendly with Elizabeth, my enemy? You don't want me back in Scotland, do you? You believe these lies, don't you? You talk to Moray and this friends, every day. But they lied about me, James. Moray and his friends killed Riccio Then killed your father, too. They stole my  husband Bothwell, stole my son...

The English Protestants want to kill me because of these letters. You are a wicked woman! they say: You killed your husband, Darnley, and now you want to kill our Queen Elizabeth. You 're going to die!

​	I did not kill my husband, I said. And when I came to England, I did not want to kill your Queen. I asked her help—I wanted to go back to Scotland! But, my lords, she put me in prison for twenty years! Twenty years, my lords!I want to be free— don't you understand that? when men write to me and try to help me, then yes, sometimes I write back! Why not? Is that wicked, do you think?

​	They didn't listen. Of course not. They want to kill me . And so they wrote to Queen Elizabeth. And now I sit here, in Fotheringhay Castle, and wait for her to answer. I do not want to die, James my son, but I do  not want to live all my life in an English Prison. I am old, and tired of life. Think well of me, James, my son, and...
