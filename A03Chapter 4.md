# Chapter 4

​	Commander Zadak was in his room at the biggest hotel in Kisangani. Suddenly, he heard the phone.

​	Commander? someone said, very quietly. A man and a woman—from Ship OM-45 in prison 888. the phone went dead. Zadak put the phone down, stood up, and left his room.

​	Prison 888 was a big white building windows, near Gog's house. There were a lot of guards at the gate, and some more guards marched past the building. All the guards carried guns.

​	Commander Zadak walked across the road to the prison. I want to visit someone . My name is Commander Zadak.

​	I'm sorry, Commander , a guard said. We can't open the gate. Nobody can go in without a letter from Earth Commander.

​	That's all right, Zadak said. and walked along the road, past the prison.

​	A guard ran behind him. Excuse me, Commander, he said quickly. Please come back tonight. I can open the back gate at midnight. You can see the two people from Ship OM-45.

​	Zadak looked at the guard. Your captain's going to kill  you.

​	The guard smiled. My captain phoned you about the two people from OM-45. He's the brother of Captian Seru.

​	Zadak didn't smile. The prison commander is going to kill you and your captian.

​	It doesn't matter, the guard said. We went to help.

​	Midnight, Zadak said. and walked away.

​	At midnight there were four guards at the front gate of prison 888, and there was one guard at the back gate. The guard opened the gate and Zadak went in. The guard said nothing. They walked downstairs into a big room. A lot of prisons slept on the floor because there were no beds or chairs. Kiah and Rilla sat on the floor near the door.

​	You can talk for five minutes, the guard said quietly.

​	The next guard arrives at 12.15.

​	Kiah and Rilla stood up. Good evening ,Commander, they said.

​	Zadak looked at the prisoners. Why are all these people here? he said to Kiah and Rilla. They're in prison because Gog doesn't like them. I talk to Gog about rain, I talk to him about the AOL, but he never listens. Today, someone told me about some fires in the new forest here in Africa; but Gog doesn't want to hear about those fires . Zadak laughed angrily. And he doesn't want to hear about my trees in Australia. He never listens to me. He's always thinking about Mars, Not about our beautiful planet Earth.

​	Kiah listened carefully. Take it easy, Commander, he said quietly. Please talk to Adai. Adai wants to help. He can come back from the Moon and help you.

​	No, Zadak said. I phoned Adai this afternoon. He's a good man and he wants to help. But I don't need help. I'm going to stop Gog; I'm going to kill him.

​	Kiah closed his eyes for a minute. Gog's guards have guns. They can kill you. Commander, he said. You need more people to help. Wait for Adai. He can help you to look for more people.

​	No, Kiah, Zadak said quitly. I don't want more people. Adai can come back to Earth after Gog is dead after I am dead. perhaps. I don't want Adai to die,too.

​	Excuse me, Commander, the guard said. He looked at the clock near the door.

​	Ok, Let's go,Zadak said to the guard. He looked at Rilla and then at Kiah. His eyes were very blue. Goodbye, he said.

​	Goodbye.Commander, Kiah said.

​	Be careful! Rilla cried. And good luck!

​	Early that morning, Earth Commander's house was quiet. A guard opened the door.

​	Good morning, Commander Zadak, he said. Earth Commander isn't in his office.

​	That's all right, Zadak said. I can wait.

​	Zadak went upstairs and waited.

​	At eight o'clock Bel came into the room. Good morning,Commander, she said. You're early this morning. Are you happier today? Earth Commander was very angry with you yesterday.Don't begin talking about rain or the AOL today.

​	Zadak smiled, but his blue eyes were cold.No, he said. I'm not going to talk about rain today.

​	Just then, Gog came into the room. He looked at Zadak. What' s wrong? Why are you here at eight o'clock in the morning?

​	Zadak took his gun from his pocket. Gog saw the gun and his face went white. His eyes were dark and afraid. For a second nobody moved.

​	Suddenly, Bel's black and white cat ran into the room.	

​	Guards!guards!Bel shouted.

​	The cat jumped at Zadak, and Zadak hit the cat away from him. Bel ran across the room to Gog and Zadak, at that second, shot at Gog. But Bel was between him and Gog. She gave a cry and fell to the floor. Her hair looked very red on the black floor.

​	No! Gog cried. You shot Bel!

​	Three guards ran into the room with their big guns and stood in front of Gog.

​	Kill him! Gog shouted, and began to help Bel.

​	Zadak looked at the guards and then at Bel and Gog. Kiah was right; he was going to die.

​	I'm sorry , Kiah . I'm sorry, Adai, he said quietly. The guards shot Zadak. Slowly, he fell to the floor.
