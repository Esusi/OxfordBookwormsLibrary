# Chapter 4

​	On the twenty-seventh day of April, the guards took my mother and James to Lancaster Castle, and my life at Read Hall Began. Suddenly, it was spring. The sky was blue and there were beautiful flowers on the hills. From Read Hall, Pendle Hill looked different: it looked smaller, and it was not so important in my life. Sometimes I walked along Sabden Brook to Sabden, and then to Newchurch, and I felt happy to be near Pendle Hill again. But I never visited Malkin Tower again.

​	Spring changed into summer, and in August I went to Lancaster with Mr Nowell. Lancaster was thirty miles from Read Hall, andI got very tired because I sat on a horse for hours. I was a big, noisy town. I never saw so many before in my life and I felt afraid.

​	The trial of the witches of Pendle began at Lancaster Castle on the eighteenth day of August, and the judge was an important man from London. Judge Bromley listened to many people on that day, because there were a lot of witches from Lancashire in the prison. Old Demdike was not there because she died in May, before the judge arrived.

​	I waited with Mr Nowell's servant, and when a guard called me name, I went through a big door and saw the judge behind a table. Judge Bromley was rich and important, but his eyes were cold. Suddenly, I saw my mother! She was dirty and very thin. When she saw me, her face went red. My hair was clean now, and I wore shoes and an expensive dress. I saw my mother's eyes: she hated me!

​	Are you a witch? Judge Bromley asked my mother.

​	No, I'm not, my mother answered angrily.

​	Did you kill Jack Robinson, of Barley village?

​	No, I did not.

​	Jennet Device is here, a voice said quietly. It was Mr Nowell. She can tell us the truth about her mother.

​	For a minute, my mother did not move. Then she ran across the room and shouted at me. You know nothing, you bad child! And i'm your mother! Don't forget that!

​	The guards ran after my mother and pulled her the floor.

​	I'm no witch! my mother shouted. It's all lies! You're a witch a child of the Devil! You're my daughter, and I know!

​	I was afraid and I put my hands over my eyes. I didn't want to see my mother's ugly face. The guards pulled my mother out of the room and the noise stopped.

​	Jennet Device, the judge said. Tell us the truth about your mother.

​	Roger Nowell lifted me  up and put me on a table in front of the judge.

​	My mother is a witch, I began. She has a friend, a dog called Bel. When she wants to kill somebody, she tells Ball I talked and talked;I told the judge?

​	Judge Bromley listened carefully. My child, is this the truth?

​	Yes, I answered. I'm telling you the truth.

​	The guards brought my mother back into the room again. Her face looked tired and her eyes were red.

​	Elizabeth Device, your daughter told us about your dog, Ball.Your son, too, told us about the clay pictures. We know everything.

​	My mother said nothing. She didn't look at the judge and she didn't look at me.

​	Next, the guards brought my brother James into the room. When I saw James, I wanted to cry. James was thin and dirty his hair was very long. He looked at the judge and at all the rich and important men in the room and he began to cry. Then he sat down on the floor.

​	Stand up, James Device, Judge Bromley said.
