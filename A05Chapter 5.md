# Chapter 5

​	That Wednesday a letter also arrived for the young Vi comte de Chagny. He opened the letter, saw the name at the bottom, and smiled for the first time that day.

​	Dear Raoul

​	Of course I remember you! How could I forget you?

​	Meet me on Thursday at three O'clock in the Tuileries Gardens. Don't be angry with me, Raoul, please.

​	Christine Daae

​	Raoul put the letter carefully into his pocket Angry? How could he be angry with an angel? On Thursday he was in the Tuileries Gardens by two o'clock.

​	At ten past three he began to feel unhappy. At half past three  he  wanted to die, or to kill somebody.

​	And then … she came. She ran through the gardens to him, and in a second she was in his arms.

​	Oh, Christine! he said, again and again. Oh, Christine! They  walked through the gardens together and talked for a long time. They remember their happy weeks in Brittany, four years ago.

​	But why did you go away, Christine? Raoul asked. Why didn't you write to me?

​	For a minute or two Christine said nothing. Then she said slowly, We were so young, you and I. I was just a poor singer from Norway, and you,,, you were the Vicomte de Chagny. I knew I could never be your wife.

​	But I love you, Christine.

​	No, shh, LIsten to me, Raoul ,please. I went home to Nor way, and a year later, my father died. I was very unhayyp, but I came back to France, to Paris. I worked and worked at my singing, because I wanted to be an opera singer. Not just a good singer, but the best opera singer in Paris.

​	And now you are, Raoul said. He smied. All Paris is at your feet.

​	Christine, Raoul said quietly. I want to ask you a question.Who was the man in your dressing-room on Tuesday night? Tell me, please!

​	Christine stopped and stared at him. Her face went white. What man? she whispered. There was no man in my dressing-room on Tuesday night.

​	Raoul put his hand on her arm. I heard him, he said. I listened outside the door and hear a man's voice. Who was he?

​	Don't ask me, Raoul ! There was a man's voice, yes, but there was no man in my room! it's true! Oh, Raoul, I'm so afraid. Sometimes I want to die.

​	Who is he? Tell me, Christine, please. I'm your friend, I can help you. Tell me his name!

​	I cannot tell you his name. It's secret. whispered Christine. I never see him, I only hear his voice. But he is everywhere! He sees everything, hears everything. That's why I didn't speak to you on Tuesday night. He is my music teather, Raoul. He's a wonderful singer. I sang so well on Tuesday night because of him. I am famous because of him. He is my angel of music! And he says he loves me. How can I leave him?
