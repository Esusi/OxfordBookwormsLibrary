# Chapter 6

​	Three days later, in the big, new cemetery two miles from their house, the two old people said goodbye to their dead son. Then they went back to their dark, old house.They did not want  to live without Herbert, but they waited for something good to happen, something to help them. The days went by very slowly. Sometimes they did not talk because there was nothing to say without Herbert. Ant so the days felt very long.

​	Then, one night, about a week later, Mrs White got out of bed because seh could not sleep. She sat by the window and she watched and waited for her son. He did not  come and she began to cry quietly.

​	In the dark her husband heard her and he called, Come back to bed.It's cold out there.

​	It's colder for my son, his wife answered. He's out there in the cold cemetery.

​	Mrs White did not go back to bed, but Mr White was old and tired  and the bed was warm. So, in the end, he went to sleep again. Suddenly he heard a cry from his wife.

​	The paw! she cried. The monkey's paw! She came back to the bed and stood there.

​	What is it? What's the matter? Mr Whate cried. He sat up in bed. What's the matter? he thought. Why is she excited? What's she talking about? He looked at his wife.

​	Her face was very white in the dark. I want it, she said quietly, and you've got it! Give it to me! Please!

​	What? Mr White asked.

​	The monkey's paw, Mrs White said. Where is it?

​	It's downstairs, Mr White answered. Why?

​	Mrs White began to laugh and cry. We can have two more wishes! she cried. We had one but there are two more!

​	Oh,no! Not again! Think , woman! Mr White cried. But Mrs White did not listen.

​	Quickly, she said. Go and get the paw. We're going to wish for our boy to come back to us!

​	No! Mr White cried. You're mad!

​	Get it! Get it quickly! Mrs White cried again.

​	Mr White said again, Think woman! Think! Our boy was in the machinery for a long time. They didn't want to show him to us! Think ! Do yo want to see his body?

​	Yes! He's my son. I'm not afraid of him! she answered.

​	You don't understand , Mr White said sadly, but he went downstairs to look for the monkey's paw.

​	In the living-room it was dark and Mr White did not have a candle. Slowly, he went across the room and he put out his hand for the monkey's paw. He touched it, and quickly took his hand away again.

​	No! he thought. I can't I don't want to see Herbert! His face after he was in the machinery no!

​	Then he thought about his wife and he put out his hand and took the paw.

​	In the bedroom his wife waited. She saw the paw in Mr White's hand and cried, Quick! Make the wish!

​	I can't, Mr White answered. Remember he died in the machinery!

​	Make the wish! I'm not afraid of my own son! Mrs White cried again.

​	Mr White looked sadly at his wife, but he took the paw in his right hand and said slowly, I wish for my son, Herbert, to come back to us. then he sat down in the nearest chair.

​	But Mrs White went over to the window and looked out into the road. She stayed there for a long time and did not move. Nothing happened. The monkey's paw could not do it!

​	Thank God! Mr White said, and he went back to bed.

​	Soon Mrs White went to bed too.
