# Chapter 2

​	So next day, at seven o'clock, I came to the shop in a cab. There were not very many people in the road because  it was early in the morning. In November it is  dark seven o'clock in the morning and I could not see the shop very well. I waited five minutes Apostman walked past. Then the door of the shop of the shop opened, and the creature Merrick, camae out.

​	I could not see his face or his body. He had an enormous black hat on his head, like a big box. A grey cloth came down from the hat , infant of his face. There was a hole in the cloth in front of his eyes. He could  see out of the hole but I could not see in. He wore a long black coat too. The coat began at his neck, and ended at his feet, so I could not see his arms his body, or his legs. On his feet he wore big shoes, like old bags.

​	He had a stick in his left hand, and he walked very slowly. I opened the door of the cab,and got out.

​	Good morning, Mr Merrick, I said. Can you get in?

​	Elpmy pastels, he said.

​	I'm sorry. I said. I donn't understand.

​	For a minute he stood by the door of the cab and said nothing. Then he hit the cab with his stick.

​	STEPS! he said loudly. Help me up the steps!

​	Then I understood. There were three steps up into the cab and he could not get up them.

​	Yes, I see. I'm sorry,I said Let me help you.

​	I looked behind me. It was the postman. And behind him, I could see three young boys. One of the boys laughed.

​	The postman smiled. Is the gentleman ill? He asked.

​	I thought quickly. Yes But this is a lady, not agentman. I'm a doctor, and she 's ill. Take her hand , so I can help her better.

​	The postman took Merrick's left hand, and I helped him with two hands from behind. Slowly, very slowly, Merrick went up the steps and into the cab.

​	One boy was very near the cab. He called to his friends.

​	Come and see this,boys A fat lady in a black coat! And look at that enormous hat!

​	The boys laughted. They were very near the cab too. now. I closed the door quickly.

​	Thank you, I said to the postman.

​	That's ill that's all, I said quickly. We're going to the hospital. Goodbye, and thank you.

​	The cab drove down the road to the hospital. I locked at Merrick. That was difficult, wasn't it? I said.

​	At first he said nothing, but then he spoke. His voice was very strange, but I listened to him carefully, and I could understand him.

​	The steps were very difficult, he said. But most things are difficult for me.

​	Yes, I said. Nothing is easy for you, is it?

​	No, he said. He was very quiet for a minute. Then he said, Who are you sir?

​	Who am I? Oh, I'm sorry. My name is Dr Treves. Here, this is my card.

​	I gave him a card with my name on. Then I thought, That was no good. This man can't read But Merrick took the card and looked at it very carefully. Then he put it in his trousers pocket.

​	I did not talk to him very much at the hospital.I looked at his head and arms and legs and body very carefully. Then I wrote the important things about him in a little book. A nurse helped me.Merrick looked at her sometimes, but she did not smile at him or talk to him.I think she was afraid of him. I think Merrick was afraid too. because he was very quiet.

​	At four o'clock I took him back to the shop in a cab. The next day I looked in the shop window again, but the picture was not there.
