# B1 Everything to Know About Las Vegas

​	Every cliche about America is blow up in Las Vegas, blared from the neon horizon. Rightly so,as the city delivers more glitz and activity than can rightly fit in one average day. But reinvention is in its DNA, from the Gold Rush to the mafia era and ties to Cuba. Now the downtown area, under development by Zappos founder Tony Hsieh, is an attempt to develop a new normal with hipster bars, a burgeoning gallery scene and recreation park made of storage containers. LIke the buffets, there's something for everyone.

​	WHEN TO GO

Spring and fall are the ideal times to go to Sin City. Summer is really , really hot, but with all the pools and air-conditioning, the desert heat isn't really a deterrent.

​	CELEBRATE

The Life is Beautiful Festival is worth plannng around if you like more than 12000 people for three days of music ,art,talks, and culinary delights . If electrnic music is more your speed, Electric Daisy Carnival is godmother of EDM festivals. If you're looking for a more rustic experience, check out the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo fro cowboys and country music in December.

​	WHAT TO EAT

Buffets! If there's one food form Sin City has perfected, it's the all-you-can-eat mountains of food in queues. It's everything you want, when you want it, from fried food to haute cuisine and let's never forget desserts. Remember, more is more, and it's always available.

​	INSTAGRAM-WOTHEY VIEW

The Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign says it all. For the best lighting, take your photos at sunset.

​	SUSTAINABLE TRAVEL TIP

Take the Monorail or buses or walk the Strip. It's also possible to travel on foot almost entirel indoors, because of the connections between the buildings to beat the heat.

​	SOUVENIR TO TAKE HOME

Should you cash in your casino chips, you can buy some real estate, or at least Monopoly: The Las Vegas Edition. For something tastier, what about an Elvis PEZ candy roll dispenser or other such candy? There's also the Ethel M ,of the candy empire  chocolate factory and cactus botanical garden (largest in the southwest) in Henderson.After watching chocolate getting made, take some home. If all else fails, there's always fuzzy dice. After all, not everyone leaves with a marriage license.

# Dramatic Photos Show How Sand Mining Threatens a Way of Life in Southeast Asia

> In An Giang Province, Vietnam, a half-mile stretch of riverfront along the Van River collapsed in April 2017, plunging houses and part of the road the river. Sand mining had weakened the bank

One afternoon last year, Ha Thi Be 67, was siting with her son in her tiny coffee shop in the town of Hong Ngu, looking out on the lazy Tien River, the main branch of the Mekong in Vietnam, Suddenly, the ground beneath them gave way. The river bank was crumbing into the water. We shouted out loud and ran, she says. It srashed with a huge sound, boom, boom.

Be and her son escaped unharmed, but the  coffee shop and her nearby house were destroyed. It took all of what we owned to build the house, and now it's all gone, she sighes. Still, Be counts herself luncky. If it had happened at night, I and my grand would have died. We used to sleep in that house, she says.

​	The main causes of the collapse can be seen floating in many places on the Tien's murky waters dredging boats , using rackety pumps to raise from the river bed enormous quantities of sand. In recent years,that humble substance has become an stonishingly hot commodity. Sand is a key ingredient in concrete, the essential building material of Vietnam's fast-growing cities. Demand for it is surging  and that is wreaking havoc not only on Vietnam's rivers, but also on the all important Mekong Delta. (Read about the damming of the Mekong in the magazine)

> Left:Ha Thi Be and her two grandsons stand in the ruins of her ancestral home along the Tien River in Dong Thap Province. The goverment warned her to relocate inland to live with her son in January 2017, two months before the house eventually collapsed.But everything I own was in this house, and now everything is gone, she said. 
>
> Right:In July 2017 Ba Tu 72,returned to what's left of her house in Nha Be, a suburb of Ho Chi Minh CIty. Four days earlier, part of the house had fallen into the river. Ba Tu was home with her daughter-in-law when it happened, but both women escaped injury.

In towns and villages all along the Mekong River and many other rivers around the country, banks undermined by dredging are collapsing into the water, taking with them farm fields,fish ponds ,shops and homes. Inrecent years, thousands of acres of rice farms have been lost, and at least 1200 families have had to be relocated. Hundreds more have evacaated in-stream islands that were literally disappearing beneath their feet. Goverment offcials estimate some 50000 people in the Mekong Delta area alone need to be moved out of such landslide zones.

​	River sand mining isn't only a problem for people: It also muddies waters and scours riverbeds, killin gthe fish, plants ,and other organisms that live there. When I was a child, we'd catch fish and snails to eat, Recalls Ha Thi Be. Since the sand dredges came, the fish and snails are no more.

## A Globle Problem

Vietnam is far from the only place where sand mining is inflicting such damage.All over the developing world, cities are growing at a furious pace, devouring sand in unprecedented quantities. The unmber of Vietnamese living in cities has double in the last twenty years, to some 32 million. Worldwide, the urban population is risin gby about 65 million people annually; that's the equivalent of adding eight New York Cites to the planet every single year. Nearly 50 billion tons of sand and gravel is extracted anually to create all the concrete office towers , apartment blocks, highways, and airports those people need. (Some Vietnamese sand is also sold to nearby Singapore, which uses gargantuan amounts to build artificial land)

Why,you might ask, don't we simply mine sand from the Sahara and other deserts? The answer is desert sand doesn't work in concrete the wind eroded grains are too smooth and rounded. As a result, from China to Jamaica, from Liberia to India,sand miners are plundering riverbeds, floodplains,and beaches for the preciou grains.

# Once Written Off for Dead, the Aral Sea Is Now Full of Life

Omirserik Ibragimov fixed his gaze on the hole he had carved out from the Aral Sea. The 25-year-old's hands moved steadily , pulling out a fishing net that he and father had left under the solid, snow-covered surface just three days earlier.

​	After a minute marked by tense silence, two breams emerged from the hole. Then three pike-perches , their silver scales shimmering as they struggled against the net's green meshing.

​	Here comes the gold, Omirserik said with a smile as he continued tugging the net. The pike-perch,with its tender flesh and few bones, is considered to be the most valuable catch, selling for roughly 650 tenge(a little over 2) for a kilogram; local fishermen refer to them as gold fish.

His father ,Kidirbai,worked with his bare hands to free the fish, his knuckles flush from the freezing water. After gathering all their nets, their total catch of the day was about 77 pounds of pike-perch and 44 pounds of bream a sizable haul for a few hours of work.

Just 15 years earlier, this would not have been possible. Once the world's fourth-largest freshwater lake,with an area of some 26000 square miles, the Aral Sea became the victim of the Soviet Union's agricultural policies in the 1950s.Water from its two river sources the Amu Darya and Syr Darya was intentionally diverted for cotton cultivation.

As decreasing water flow into the sea caused a rise in salinity, the abundant freshwater fish species began to die out. By the 1980s, the fishing industry in the Aralsk district once a robust source of employment for the region was wiped out , forcing a mass migration of people. The remaining population was hit by extreme weather, brought on by the dired-out Aral seabed, and deteriorating health.

The people destroyed the sea and then nature took revenge on the people, said Madi Zhasekenow, the director of the Aralsk Regional Museum and Fishermen Museum.

## MASSIVE DISASTER

This repid collapse over less than three decades which environmental scientists say is one of the planet's worst ecological disasters is marked today by the sea's reduced size. Its total area of water, straddling Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan , is now a tenth of its original size. What's left has broken into two distinct bodies: the North and South Aral Seas. In Uzbekistan, the entire eastern basin of the South Aral Sea is completely desiccated, leaving merely a single strip of water in the west.(Learn about other vanishing lakes around the world)

But Kazakhstan's North Aral Sea has seen a happier outcome,thanks to a nearly 86 million project financed in large part by the World Bank. Along with repairs to existing dikes around the basin to prevent spillage, an eight-mile dam was constructed just south of the Syr Darya River. Completed in the summer of 2005,this dam, named Kokaral, surpassed all expectations.It led to an 11 foot increase in water levels after just seven months a goal that scientists initially expected would take three years.

This turnarouond in the North Aral Sea's fate has meant that the fish stocks have returned to its waters, injecting new life into the local communities. Just as goverment policies had doomed the Aral Sea, careful planning and research helped revive at least part of it.\

Kristopher White, a researcher and professor of Almaty's KIMEP University who has studied the  economic impacts of the Aral Sea's desiccation,explained that while the sea will never return to its former size, the 18 percent increase in mass of the North Aral Sea is a testament to how political will and scientific research can benefit the environment.

Anthropogenic ecological damage can be reversed by human interventions, said White.

## OPTIMISM AND HOPE

At its peak in 1957, the Aral Sea produced more than 48 tons of fish, representing roughly 13 percent of the Soviet Union's fish stocks. By the 1980s, due to the rising salinity of the sea, the 20 native species of fish were decimated; coommercial harvests plummeted to zero 1987.The water from the sea receded, and today, the shore is about 12 miles(20 kilomietres )from Aralsk.

​	The major source of employment was gone, and with it optimism and hope for the future, said White. And that really prevailed throughout the region until the completion of this dam.

During those decades, flounder was the only fish that could survive the high-salinity North Aral Sea. But after the Kokaral Dam was finished, the average salinity dropped from 30 grams to 8 grams per  liter, prompting the return of almost two dozen freshwater species through the Syr Darya river.

​	According to the Aralsk Fish Inspection Unit, fish catch in the North Aral Sea has grown six-fold since 2006, when the bulk of the 1360 tons caught was flounder. By 2016 tons of fish was caught, with bream being the most common, followed by roach and the sought-after pike-pech. For 2018, the fishing limit is set at 8200 tons,said head inspector Esenbai Ensepov.

# 10 Strange Things You(Probably)Didn't Know About Earth

The planet we all call hom is even more bizarre than you might imagine.

​	There's no doubt that planet Earth is awe-inspiring. That's even more true for the handful of humans who've seen it from space with their own eyes.

​	We tend to think of ourselves as a weird,tiny little human being on a very large, powerful planet, and there clearly irrelevant to anything that might affect the planet at a planetary scale, says former NASA astronaut Kathryn Sullivan, who in 1984 bacame the first US woman to walk in space.In some ways that's true. But if you step back and look at the planet in total, you see how richly interconnected and interwined all the actual systems are.

​	Even with all its magnificence and majesty, Earth is also just kind of strange.Aside from the fact that it's the only planet known(so far) to support lefe, it has a bunch of inherent quirks, from geophysical weirdness to the landscapes adorning its surface to the organisms it supports. And the  more we learn about Earth's peculiarities, the more we grow to appreciate and treasure its many wonders-starting with the air we breathe.

​	You look back at the Earth and that huge majestic ocean, the atmosphere is a lot more like the fuzz on a tennis ball than some big massive thing, Sullivan says. It's like the wall of a soap bubble, this littlt membrane that envelops this grain of rock and is the reason that critters like us can live.

​	Here are some of the oddest things about this gas-shrouded ball of water and rock we call home.

## The Planet's Poles Flip

​	We all know that North is, well,north—somewhere above Alaska-and south is down near the middle of Antarctica. That will always be true for the planet's geographic poles, but it's only intermittently true for the planet's magnetic poles. Over the past 20 million years, the magnetic poles have flip-flopped every several hundred years or so, which means that if you had a compass in hand about 800000 years ago, it  would tell you that north was in Antarctica.

​	Though scientists are pretty sure Earth's churning, molten iron core powers these polar acrobatics, it's not entirely clear what triggers the actual reversals.The process is gradual and occure over millenia, For now, Earth's north magnetic pole is creeping northward by about 40 miles a year.And given that the last major pole reversal happened 78000 years ago, we are overdue for a flip.

	## It Has a Supersized Moon

Sunday evening marked the most recent rising of the supermoon, but regardless of how large Earth's moon appears in the sky on any given night, it's always among the solar system's most overgrown satellites.Relative to Earth, it's positively enormous, coming in at a quarter as wide as our home planet.

​	The only celestial twosome that bests Earth-moon team in this regard is Pluto and its biggest moon Charon,which really from more of a binary system- a pair of objects twirling around each other—rather than a typical planet moon pair. And thank goodness the moon is so big and so close. If it were smaller or farther away, we would never see total solar eclipses.

## The Biggest Mammal Migration Is Airborne

Yep,you may have thought the 1.3 million wildbeest that hoof their way between Kenya and Tanzania were tops, but you'd be wrong.

​	Millions and millions of bats-giant  fruit bast, to be exact-fly between teh Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia's Kasanka National Park each year.With more than 10 million of these cat-size, mango-munching, echolocating chiropterans involved, it's the largest known mammal migration on Earth.

# This Tiny Beetle Is Devastating Forests In the Worst Outbreak Ever

​	Despite being smaller than a grain of rice, mountain pine beetles are causing big problems for pine forests across North America.Bark beetle colonies feed and reproduce on the inner bark of ponderosa and limber pines, wreaking deadly havoc on the tree's ability to circulate nutrients and absorb water. Due to changes in climate and other factors, the recent outbreak of these destructive insects has reached proportions never before seen in recorded history.Alarming estimates from the US Forest Service state that 100 beetle-infested trees fall daily across the United States.

​	To combat this epidemic, Professor Diana Six has made it her mission to crack the genetic code of the pine tree. She hopes that studying the relationship between the mountain pine beetle and the trees they kill will provide us with valuable insight into the future of our forests.In this short film made at the International Wildlife Film Festival Filmmaker Labs, Professor Six walks among the trees and shares her thoughts on why humans can do more to conuteract the effects of climate change.

# Why the Brain-Body Connection Is More important Than We Think

​	Our brains aren't flying solo; our emotions also come into play when we're interacting with the world, new research finds.

​	The idea that our brains are like giant supercomputers, orchestrating and determining everything we do, has gained ground in recent years. So too have ideas that a short time ago would have been regarded as science fiction, like downloading the Internet directly to our brains, or creating a new kind of human, one with enhanced cognitive powers.

​	In his new book, The Biological Mind, Alan Jasanoff,professor of biological engineering at MIT, explains why this cerebral mystique creates a false dichotomy between the brain and the body and ignores bodily influences on our psychology,from chemicals in the blood to bacteria in the gut.

​	Speaking from his office at MIT, he explained why Red Sox legend Ted Williams has his body frozen;why changes in temperature influence how much Dutch police shoot their guns; and why the idea of downloading the Internet directly into our brains is not a good one.

# One of the underlying concepts in your book is what you call the cerebral mystique.Can you explain what it means and why this view of the brain is distorting our real natures?

​	This book is largely about two  opposite ideas:the biological mind centered on the brain, in which influences from the rest of  the body and outside the body shape what we think and do, and the cerebral mystique, a complex of  sterotyper and ideals about the brain, which tend to treat it as an isolated and all-powerful entity,almost like a modern version of th soul.

​	The problem with having a dualistic view of the brain and its relationship to the physical body, and the physical world, is that it makes us see ourselves as unnaturaly self-contained, both as minds and as autonomous agents. In other words, we view ourselves as things that operate from within, so we're less sensitive to things that influence us on the outside. The idea that the brain is a machine, an abstract entity like a giant supercomputer, has been around for a  while, basically since computers. Other people have used a quantum analogy for the brain. But the idea of the brain as a computer is the most common in this day and age.

# New research suggsts that our emotions, as much as our brains, are key in mediating how we perceive and interact with the world. Tell us about Lauri Nummenmaa's study.

Yes! People have at various times in history been sensitized to the ways the body and brain coordinate emotions. A fascinating study published a few years ago asked participants to map, on pictures of their own body, where they feel sensations as they experience different emotions. The investigators looked at something like 15 variegated emotions and found different bodily maps for each of those things. The first group of participants was Finnish.To test for cultural biases, they looked at a second group, I think Japanese, and found similar responese.

​	Probably the most famous person who has advocated the view  that emotions are key to learning or behavior is Daniel Kahneman. His studies showed that there's this apparently repid, irrational, shoot-from -the-hip way to make decisions, which is important in the behaviroal side of economics. In our field in neuroscience, Antonio Damasio has argued for many  years that there's a loop between the body and the brain. This involves bodily signatures that get tied to different contexts in our enviroment, and steer us towards different behavioral outcomes. This is one way in which the body is cognitively involved in our actions, in a way many people wouldn't believe when confronted with the more mystical view of the  brain as a self-contained machine.

# A new area of neuroscience known as connectomics seeks to give a kind of unifying theory of the brain.Explain what it means, and what the Human Connectome Project is doing

​	Connectiomics means two differnet things in our community.The one I personally interact with is more about mapping the individual's structures, chiefly cells in the brain. The Human Connectome Project is a bit different because it looks, at roughly three orders of magnitude lower resolution, at the superhighways that connect different regions of the brain and tries to relate those to aspects of brain activity and genetics. What both these views have in common is that they're trying to describe key aspects of brain funciton in terms of its intrinsic structure.

# Find Bliss in This Stunning Floral Kingdom

> Whether exporing these unique flowers in the wild, or touring the Kirstenbosch botanical gardens, teh rare flora in this kingdom is sure to impress.

​	Many travelers visit South Africa to see the Big Five animals, soak in the views from Table Mountain, or relax on a beach where two oceans meet-essential experiences in this multicultureal nation. There is so much to offer in South Africa, that one of its most unique qualities can sometimes go overlooked. The world is divided into six Floral Kingdoms, also called Floristic Regions. South Africa is home to the smallest-by far- and most unique Floral Kingdom, as designated by plant geographers. Thirty percent of the plant genera in South Africa's Cape Floristice Regions are found nowhere else in the world.

​	Here are five ways to experience the unique flora of the fynbos,or fine bush, in this UNESCO World Heritage site all within a day's drive from Cape Town.

​	On the edge of bustling Cape Town, find yourself in a colorful, kaleidoscopic escape. The 1300-acre garden is expansive and beautifully organized. Get lost in the hills of color, follow a detailed map, or join a free walking tour(after paying the five dollar entry fee). The garden is also home to frequent music and movie events on summer evenings. And not to be missed o a clear day is the Boomslang Tree Canopy Walkway, a steel and timber bredge that winds(like a boomslang ,or tree snake)through the canopy providing aerial views of the gardens and Table Mountain.

​	From most areas in Cape Town it is hard to miss the New7 Wonder of Nature that is Table Mountain. A cable car can take you up and down the mountain should you choose to skip a hike, just be sure to check the site frequently for weather and wait time updates. Table Mountain National Park boasts more plant species than all of New Zealand, so hiking , expecially with a guide or  naturalist, will give you the opportunity to truly experience the unparalleled diversity.  Consult with a guide company like Hike Table Mountain to find which of the hundreds of possible routes is best for you.

# The Giant Squid Nebula and More Animals of the Cosmos

> As galixies collide and new stars are born, spectacular shapes form in the universe-and many of them resumble Earthly creatures.

​	If you can't get enough of the animals here on Earth, just look forward the heavens.There you will find eagles,elephants,whals,and more-as long as you have a powerful telescope and an even more powerful imagination.

​	Astronomers have long named galaxies, nebulae, and other astronomical phenomena for the animals they resemble when observed from Earth.Now these animal look-alikes, comprised of starts and stardust,number in the dozons.Nebulae alone,for example,represent at least 20 example at 20 animals,from giant squid to running chickens.

​	These are the objects that really capture people's imaginations,says Karen Masters,associate professor of astronomy at Haverford Collage.It's human nature to see familiar things in the unfamiliar,(See an epic picture that shows thousands of galaxies in one frame)

​	And to early observers,these phenomena were indeed unfamiliar.Nebulae are cosmic clouds of gas and dust, linked to the birth or death of starts,whereas galaxies are ensembles of millions or billions of starts bound together by gravity.

​	Animal names, like Mice Galaxies,have been used for years-and in some cases, centuries.But they're not actually offcial, says Thierry Montmerle, former General Secretry of the International Astronomical Union,which oversees the naming of astronomical objects.

​	It's very informal, he says.The name is adopted by popular demand,and the LAU is perfectly happy with that.

# More Birds Expected for Majority of National Parks-Here's Why

> Climate change may have big impacts on avian species, and all the result may not be positive.

​	Dozons of different birds-Northern pintails,wild turkeys, Franklin's gull, Sterller's jays,and cedar waxwings,just to name a few- make homes for themselves in Yellowstone National Park during at least of the year.Millions of birdwatchers make their way here and to national parks all over the country each year to see them.

​	Collectively,birdwatchers spend 107 billion dollars annually in the US. But if climate change continues uninterrupted ,duck enthusiasts may have to  travel elsewhere if they wish to catch a glimpse of a Northern pintail.By 2050,this species could no longer find suitable habitat in Yellowstone.On the other hand, avian enthusiasts could begin to see the Western scrub jay showing up there, at least in the winter.

​	Because they can move around so easily  on their wings, birds are often considered indicator species.When the climate begins to change, birds are often the first to display a response that we notice. Recent assessments of the impacts of climate change on birds in  the US and Canada suggest that one in five species are highly vulnerable to climate change; that is , they are so particular about the temperatures they can tolerate that they may disappear entirely from some parts of their range. But if they're lucky, they can expand elsewhere into newly suitable habitat.

​	A team of research from the National Audubon Society and the US National Park Service reported Wednesday in the journal PLOS ONE that 60 percent of US national parks could become more hospitable for birds overall by the middle of the century-if climate change continues apace.In other words, the number of potential new colonizations would the number of potential local extirpations for roughly three out of every five national parks.That's based on an assessment of 513 species across 274 parks.

​	You often hear of climate change being all doom and gloom,but one of the finding is that in winter especially, parks are going to become more important sanctuaries for birds, says Audubon Society avian biologist Joanna Wu, who led the study.

Some birds may even stop migrating if winters and mild enough that they can tolerate local conditions, says Wu.

## THE POWER OF PARKS

​	The new data underscore just how critical it is to protect the national park system-often referred to as America 's Best Idea—to ensure a bright future for as many North American birds as possible, the reearchers say.

​	But they also suggest that the avian communities of the future could look dramaticallly different from the ones we know today. And it is at best unclear what ecological consequences would emerge if Wu's predictions come true.

​	We're saying that climate will become suitable ,but the species dispersal capacity, ability to find resources and food and places to raise their chicks,those are all big question marks, she say.

​	Indeed,says McGill University avian biologist Barbara Frei, who was not involved in the study, if the birds can adapt to climate change by moving north, but the trees they depend on can't, where will they nest?

# You Have to Grab This Moment

> A business icon stresses the importance of finding common ground during times of increased divesiveness in America.

​	Ann Fudge was a high school junior in segregated WashingtonDC when Martin Luther King JR was assassinated on April 4,1968.In the days that followed, while standing outside a Rhode Island Avenue convenience store waiting for her grandfather, an armed guardsman pointed a gun toward Fudge's face and asked her if she knew a curfew had been declared. The shop owner and her grandfather rushed outside to vouch for her, but the experience left an indelible mark. One of only four black girls in a class of one  hundred at Immaculata Preparatory School, Fudge made a commitment to excel in all that she set out to accomplish.She went on to attend Simmons College and Harvard Business School, becoming one of the top women business leaders in America.

​	Fudge spent several years as chairman and chief executive officer of Young & Rubicam, a globle advertising agency, and has led several business, including a five-billion-dollar division of Kraft Foods.Now, 50 years later, Fudge says that painful that her five grandchildren will not be confronted with the same racial intolerance.

​	Fudge sat down for a conversation with National Geographic Editor in Chief Susan Goldberg to discuss the legacy of Martin Luther King JR,the current racial climate in America, and the importance of communicating across differences.

​	Susan Goldberg:

​		Talk about your experience following the assassination of DR. King.

​	Ann Fudge:

​		You experience the heatbreak of this person that you felt was making a difference. My parents had gone to the March on Washington.I didn't go , but I still keep picture that were taken.They're faded now.Right away the climate was ugly.I've seen ugly stuff before . You talk to other black people they're seen ugly things before.

​	Observing the change in the city afterward was stark. It gave me a sense of incredible empowerment.I grew up in a time when there weren't even black bus drivers.We had trolleys then,or streetcars as we called them.A year or so later you saw black people in jobs you never thought you'd see, even in stores like Garfinckel's where they didn't have many salespeople. There were little things like that.I remember my parents saying,You have to grab this moment.It's a moment in time.And we don't know when the door will close again.I remember that.It's one of those things I think,I know, was a driver for me personally to make a difference and to do something different.When you think about momnets in time and history, you don't understand the history until decades later.At this juncture in my life, I think about it a lot. I think about legacy.I think about what I want for my five grandchildren. I don't ever want them to ever have to experience anything like that. And so when I see what's happening today, it pains me beyond measure.I say ,Oh my god, are we doing to go through this again?

​	Susan Goldberg:

​		Does it feel like that is what's happening?What would make it better?

​	Ann Fudge: People of goodwill have to move forward in a positive way.We cannot get sucked into criticizing every day what somebody's doing that we don't like.Things are happening, but what are we doing that's positive? I work with girls at Mother Caroline Academy.I don't want them to have bad experiences. Many of them are from immigrant familes.You have to keep them positive.I'm just going go focus on making a difference and impacting what I can, getting my friends engaged.Thank God I live in a space and grew up at a time where my network of friends is incredibly broad and diverse,both in the US and internationally. I'm grateful that I had that and not the fear, which many of my friends in Washington had.When you don't have the experience and exposure to people who are good, no matter what color you are,it clouds how you think about them and fuels your skepticism.

​	Susan Goldberg:

​		Why do you think you emerged from a pretty scary moment when somebody takes out a  gun and is pointing it at you with more strength,when other people might just retreat? What pushed you?

​	Ann Fudge:Growing up watching things on television during that period in the 60s and knowing that only by coming together would things change.

​	Washington was very segregated when I grew up. So you don't know what you don't know.And then you make friends.And you realize we truly are human being if we can step beyond and talk honestly about things.Until we get to a point where it's not just black folks talking about it among themselves or white folks talking to each other.The challenge is that it's a global issue in every country.We find ways to separate people or to make one group better than the other.

​	I saw things on television in the 50s and 60s that are seared in my head, whether it was the water hoses or the dogs . I feel like I'm back there again.I feel like I'm back to where we were before.And that's not a good feeling.For some, it's probably been nascent.Here's the that concerns me most.It's almost like, to make America great again, we have to do this with these people.It's creating a whole other dynamic.I'm so open . But I worry.

# Arctic Sea Ice Is Second-Lowest on Record

​	But the amount of ice found throughout most of the Arctic was even lower than in recent years, except for the region around Janpan.

​	Severely warm temperatures drove Arctic sea ice to a high of 5.6 million square miles this winter- one of its lowest on record, according to an annual evaluation released Friday by NASA.

​	Yet even though there was slightly more ice overall across the northern latitudes this winter than during last year's record-breaking low, scientists saw several troubling trends during the winter of 2017-2018.

​	During February, temperatures skyrocketed to a wild winter high more than 45 degress above normal in some areas, sending the North Pole-in the dead of winter, when the region is shrouded in darkness - above freezing for several days. Massive sections of Greenland, normally blanketed by thick,old ice,experienced open water for the first time on record. Much of the Bering Sea off Alaska, and for a while, the whole of the Bering Strait, was also ice-free, which is pretty remarkable, says NASA sea ice expert Alek Petty.

​	And despite not breaking last year's record, this winter continued a recent trend of being worse than scientists expected.

​	These last few winters have all been above our projections for air temperature predictions and sea-ice declines, Petty says.

## THE ARCTIC'S VALUERABILITY

​	While climate change is warming the globe,it's hitting the poles even harder.

​	And as rising temperatures drive the loss of sea ice, the loss of ice itself ends up making the situation even worse.

​	It's a two-way street,Claire Parkinson, senior climate scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center said in the agency's announcenment.The warming means less ice is going go from and more ice is going to melt. Also, because there's less ice, less of the sun's solar radiation is reflected off, and this contributes to the warming.

​	In fact, through most of the winter, the Arctic was on track to have its worst period ever. The only reason this winter ultimately did't break yet another record for low sea ice was that as cooler air in recent weeks allowed ice to reform the increase near Japan in the sea of Okhotsk was significant enough to make up for losses elsewhere.

## STORMY WEATHER

​	What happened this winter was that storms from both the Atlantic and the Pacific sent warm water and winds into the north.

​	Part of the problem, of course,is that those ocean bodies are warmer than they once were. In addition, over time, the Arctic has lost evermore of the thicker,older ice that stabilizes the entire region. That means that the wamth from storm event that pummel the Arctic travels father and does more damage, causing the ice to melt even more.

​	For example, the big hole in the ice that opened up over Greenland closed rather quickly after the heat subsided. But NASA officials say the new ice is thinner and less stable, and more susceptible to whatever warm spell comes next.

## SEE THE WILDLIFE OF ANWR

​	We recently looked back and were able to show that extreme warm periods have happened before in the Arctic, even 100 years ago, Petty says. But what we're seeing is that there's an increase in the frequency of these incidents, they are lasting longer, and the impact on sea ice is even greater. The storms are simply eating away at the sea ice more than they used to .

​	The key,of course, is that all these ice declins are having immeasurable impact on the globe- increasing heat and moisture in the atmosphere, changing mixing and circulation of the Arctic ocean, affecting what and where things live, even altering the globe climate system. And these shifts will only get worse until and unless humans dramatically scale back carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of coal , oil,and gas.

​	The changes are just going to get more severe, Petty says.

# Photos from March for Lives Events Around the Globe

> Take a look at powerful moments from the movement protesting gun violence,led by young adults,that has spread throught the world.

​	Now we fight for our lives.

​	That is the call to action urged by the March For Our Lives website following a rally that drew hundreds of thousands to Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, DC this Saturday to protest gun violence.Sister marches took place not only across the country, but around the world—adding up to 846 events globally, with one even held in Antarctica.

​	No matter the location, the unifying message of these protests was clear: Enough is enough.Many of those who carried signs or spoke at the rally demanded tougher gun-control laws, including banning the sale of assault weapons and closing loopholes on background checks.

## A NEW Class of Leaders

​	It has taken only 38 days for the surviving students of the shooting at Marjory Stonemen Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, to ignite a nationwide movement toward gun reform.

​	Many of the school's students spoke at the main March For Our Lives event in Washington DC Senior Emma Gonzalez asked the crowed to fight for your lives before it's someone else's job.

​	Perhaps the most moving part of Gonzalez's speech ,though, was silence . She allotted herself six minutes and 20 seconds for her speech — the amount of time, she said, that it had  taken Nilolas Cruz to kill 17 in Parkland and injure many more.

​	A surprise appearance was also made by Yolanda Renee King, the 9–year-old granddaughter of the revolutionary Martin Luther King JR and Coretta Scott King—and she has a dream of her own.I have a dream that enough is enough, she said. That this should be a gun-free world.Period.

​	The young, determined voives didn't stop at the stage.Children and teens of all ages showed up with signs in tow.One fourth-grade girl who came with fellow students from Francis Scott Key Elementary School in Arlignton ,Virginia, held a sign that read: We may be small but we have a voice.

​	Volunter could also be seen throughout the througs of crowds calling for people to register to vote.Stickers adorning protestors' jackets and signs counted down the day until US midterm elections , which will take place in eight months on November 6.The elections are seen as a chance to bring in more members of Congress as well as state and local officials who support gun-control measures.

## What Happens Now?

​	In every midterm election since the  Civil War, the president's party has lost an average of 32 seats in the House and two in the Senate.This year, Democrats need only 24 seats to take majority in the House, and two to take the Senate.

​	Conversation has also recently been sparked by the new spending bill, which was signed by President Trump on Friday.Agency instructions that accompany the bill note that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will now have the authority to conduct research on the causes of gun violence.

​	The problem? In 1996 Congress passed the Dickey Amendment, saying that none of the funds give to the CDC for injury prevention could be used to advocate for or promote gun control.The Arkansas Republican for which the federal amendment is named for, Jay Dickey,told  NPR that he actually regretted the decision, saying It wasn't necessary that all research stop.

# Pictures: World's Iconic Buildings Go Dark for Earth Hour

> Iconic buildings go dark to raise awareness around energy consumption and climate change.

​	The bright green lights that typically illuminate the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur—the tallest twin buildings in the world—were turned off for a recent Earth Hour—an annual event aimed at raising awareness about energy consumption.

​	Dozens of other iconic landmarks around the world, including the Parthenon in Greece, the Golden Gate Bridge in California, and Australia's Sydney Harbor Bridge,have participated in the annual event, which is sponsored by the World Wildlife Fund.

​	The first Earth Hour took has grown and spread around the world. Thousands of cities now switch off many lights for the hour in a symbol of environmental awareness.More than 170 countriyes take part, along with dozens of UNECO World Heritage Sites.

​	Connecting the event to a wider message, then-UN Secretary General Ban KiMoon said in 2015:Earth Hour is a way for the citizens of the world to send a clear message that they want action on climate change.

​	Earth Hour takes place from 8.30 to 9.30 pm, in each time zone around the planet.

​	Here are some pictures of famous monuments observing the darkness of Earth Hour in recent years.

## Acropolis

​	Dating to 447BC the Parthenon in Athens is one of the most famous surviving buildings of ancient Greece.The city of Athens has turned off its buildings' lights for Earth Hour and asked locals to follow suit.

## Sydney

​	Sydney Harbor Bridge is the largest steel arch bridge in the world,connecting its city's north and south harbors.Thousands of houses and businessess in Sydney go dark on Earth Hour.

## Eiffel Tower

​	Built as an archway for an international world fair in 1889, the Eiffel Tower got some help from Spiderman in turning its lights off on Earth Hour 2014

## The Big Apple

​	Times Square is the busiest commecial intersection in New York City and the world's most visited tourist attraction.For the first time ever,in 2014 the city called in a specialist to turn off its New Year's Eve ball, which typically remains on throughout the year.

## Minsk, Belarus

​	In the Belarusian capital of Minsk, the monument to humanist Francysk Skaryna is usually lit by the bright purple lights from the National Library.Big  department stores and universities also turned off their lights in Minsk for the event.

## Brandenburg Gate

​	The Brandenburg Gate was built in 1791 as an entryway to Berlin.It survived World War II but with extensive damage. The Earth Hour motto in Germany in 2014:You don't need to be a superhero to take action on climate change.

## The Alhambra

​	The Alhambra, a fortress-turned-palace that dates to 1258,watches over the city of Granada in southern Spain.

# Our Favorite Love Letters to Earth

​	There's a planet with poles that flip, a supersized moon, and landscapes that harbor acidic pools, boiling rivers and living clouds.

​	We call it Earth.

​	On National Geographic's new global series event One Strange Rock, filmamker Darren Aronofsky and host Will Smith take views on a Journey to explore our planet in all its fregility and ferocity.In advance of the premiere episode,we asked the world to send us love letters to the beautifully strange planet we all share.

​	We wanted to know how you feel about Earth.What do you love? What inspires you? Are there places you've been to ,things you have seen,and people you've know that have shaped how you feel about this planet?

​	The responses on Twitter,Facebook,and Instagram speak to our collective imperative to explore the planet, the good and the bad, because the more you know, the more likely you are to care—and to do something to help pretect the only home we've ever known.Here are some of our favorite responses so far.

​	Geographic,we have the privilege of covering the stories of our planet.We capture the beauty of landscapes and the animals who live in them. We explore the lives of people around the world.We take our readers and viewers to remote corners they otherwise would never see.Our journey also show us scars we have left on the planet—the clear-cut forests,pollution,unsustainable cityes.Our job is to explore all of it—the good and the bad—because the more you know, the more you care, the more likely you are to do something to help.This is our Love Letter to Earth.

​	Earth is where we call home.But how often do we imagine the BILLONS of things that had togo RIGHT in order for this place to not go WROGN.every ecosystem that had to interact perfectly to bring us to a place where we can live, breath,and THRIVE on a rock spinning at 1000mph.Earth grounds us Earth still has so much to offer  Thanx for inviting me to be a part of his amazing project

​	So happy! I was given the chance to go back to my classical roots and write this piece of music for 

# New Human Organ Was Hiding in Plain Sight

> The interstitium,scientists found,is under our skin and between our organs.Understanding it may eventually help treat disease.

​	Lurking just under your skin might be a new organ only now identified for the firtst time, say a team of scientists.

​	In a new study pulished in  the journal Scientific Reports,researchs from New York University's School of Medicine say they have found a new organ they're calling the interstitium.

​	It's nearly everywhere—just below the skin's surface, surrounding arteries and veins, casing the fibrous tissue between muscle,and lining our digestive tracts,lungs and urinary systems.

​	It looks like a mesh.The interstitium is a layer of fluid-filled compartments strung together in a web of collagen and a flexible protein elastin .Previously,scientists thought the layer was simply dense connective tissue.

​	The organ has seemingly been hidden in plain sight, and scientists say they missed it because of the way tissus is studied.Before being placed under a microscope,samples are thinly sliced and treated with chemicals that allow researchers to identify key components more easily. While the process is helpful for more easily spotting details,it drains fluid from the sample.

​	Devoid of their fluid , the compartments collapse,like a building with the floors suddenly knocked out, leaving the whole structure to flatten like a pancake.

​	To find these pockets of intrstitial fluid,medical reseachers  looked at living tissue instead of sampling dead tissue samples.They did this by using a probing technique called confocal laser endomicroscopy. The method entails using a tiny camera probe that takes a microscopic look around a human body.Tissue is lit by the endoscope's lasers and the fluorescent patterns it then refelcts are analyzed by sensors.

## ACCIDENTAL DISCOVERY

​	Scientists first noticed the compartments when looking at a bile duct. They saw what they thought might be tears in dense tissue.The images were taken to Neil Theise, a professor at NYU's School of Medicin and author on the paper.

​	You're talking about the remaining extracellular fluid that's unaccounted for, Theise says.About 70 percent of the human body is made of  water, and about  two thirds of that is  found in cells.The remaining third, says Theise, is only partically known.

​	In addition to accounting for bodily fluid, the compartments may help explain essential functions.

​	It's like a shock absober, says Theise.Not a hard, stiff material.

​	Among Theise's theories for the purpose of the interstitium is that it's a source of lymph, a fluid that moves through the body's lymphatic system and supports immunity.He says that knowing how diseases spread through this part of the body could help researchers better understand how cancer spreads.

​	Can we detect earlier by sampling fluid from the space? Can we figure out mechanisms to stop spread ? He asks.

## PROMISE AND SKEPTICISM

​	Jennifer Munson is a biomedical engineer at Virginia Tech who has looked at fluid in the body.She was not involved with the study but says its finding are promising.

​	I think what the paper shows is the benefit of having new ways to image and look at tissues.dehydrate the tissues, and you lose so much structural information, Munson notes.

​	She say she's fairly convinced these structures exist but wants to see more research before speculating on what they do, and whether its accurate to call them a new organ.

​	I'm really excited about the find but as with all scientists,I approach everything with a little skepticism, she adds.

​	Theise say he's aware of some of the skepticism surrounding his findings, but it's territory he's not shy about wading into.In 2005, he wrote an essay in Nature challening the importance of call theory a concept that holds cells as the basic structure of all organisms, and in 2001, he published a  paper finding that adult stem cells could be made to act similiarly to embryonic cells.

​	There's always going to be stuff we haven't seen before that we don't know, he adds. I'm awestruck that nature is more complicated than we allow ourselves to think .

# Bears Are Caring for Their Cubs Longer in Response to Hunting

> Result from a new study could have implications for brown bear evolution.

​	Over the years, several researchers noticed a change in  the way that Scan din avian brown bears care for their young. Sweden has one of  the fastest bear reproduction rates in  the world, and it seems that females were spending more time with their cubs.

​	We needed to provide evidence, and  then that triggered new questions, says Joanie Van de Walle, a PhD student in the Department of Biology at the Universite de Sherbrooke in Quebec, Canada.

​	Van de Walle is part of an international team of researchers who combed through decades of data on brown bear populations in Sweden to investigate this trend. By following the lives of hundreds of bears, the researchers determined that more mothers are raising their cubs for one year longer than they have in the past.

​	This behavioral shift can be directly attributed to humans, according to a study published March 27 in Nature Communications.With a population of around 3000 bears that could be increasing by as much as five percent each year, sustainable hunting tactics can keep bear numbers at bay.This behavioral shift of mother bears caring for their young for a longer time could be directly related to hunting regulations.

​	In the same way that humans shape wildlife by killing animals, we can also shape wildlife by not killing them.Long-term, this could have implications for brown bear evolution.

​	Evolutionarily, it doesn't usually make sense for wildlife to have fewer offspring and care for them over a long period of time. When facing high hunting pressure,it's logical that brown bears would have as many cubs as possible, but the team's findings contradict this.

​	The researchers looked at 22 years' worth of data,following more than 500 bears, many of them from birth to death.Before 2005, they found that only about seven percent of Scandinavian brown bear mothers kept their cubs for a year and a half. Between 2005 and 2015, the study found that more than 36 percent of females are keeping their cubs for an extra year.Although the amount of time spent with their young is changing, the strategies bear mothers are using to raise their cubs are not.

​	Hunting pressure in Sweden is high, and the researchers were surprised by these findings. But when related to a relatively recent law that makes it illegal to hunt mother bears in Sweden, the data make more sense. Staying in family groups would provide a win-win situation for females to lead safer lives protescted from hunters while allowing them more time to care for their young.

​	A single female in Sweden is four times more likely to be shot as one with a cub, Jon Sweden, a professor in the Department of Ecology and Natural Resource Management at the University of Life Sciences,says in a press release.

​	Caring for the cubs for a longer time has the added bonus of giving them a better chance of survival long-term.The researchers found that femals cubs that received extended parenting survived their second year of life.But 22 percent of cubs that were cut loose after a year and a half didn't make it to three years.In addition to being hunted by humans, all cubs that mothers let go of early were more likely to be killed by other bears  over brawls for teritory or resources.

​	This new technique of reproducing slower but taking care of cubs for longer outpaces reproductive opportunities, Van de Walle says.

# Striking Photos of The Men Who Work in an Active Volcano

> Mount Ijen's gorgeous vistas have captivated travelers for centures,but in recent years, its sulfur mine has become a controversial tourist attraction.

> Thirty-six-year-old Hadis has been a full-time miner for 10 years.He recently started as a cook in a nearby tourist restaurant,but periodically returns to the mine for extra income.

​	A trick veil of smoke erases the sky over Mount Ijen, the scent of burent matches saturates the air.

​	The noxious material that seeps from the bowels of East Java's active volcano is incongruous with human life-it stings the eyes, burns the lungs, and corrodes the skin. But since 1968, the sulfur miners of Mount Ijen have venturend into this unpredicatable labyrinth of gas clouds and superheated fumardoles to extract devil's gold and carry it back down the mountain—a portrait of bone—crushing physical labor.

​	Mount Ijen hosts one of the last remaining active sulfur mine in the world, and while its otherworldly vistas have captivated scientists and travelers for more than two centuries, in recent decades, the miners themselves have become a controversial tourist attraction.

## EVVIL'S GOld

​	Every day, miners make the arduous trek up Ijen's 9000-foot slopes under the cover darkness before descending another 3000 feet into the crater, where a network of man-made cermic piples funels the gases responsible for precipitating elemental sulfur.

​	Enveloped in toxic fumes and heat, they chip away at the hardend blocks and carry 150 to 200-pound loads back up the crater twice a day, earning an average of five dollars per trip.

​	Around 2.am when the first miners begin their ascent, hundreds of tourists are already streaming across the flanks of Ijen to witness its iconic blue flames, which can only be seen at night .Its half-mile turquoise creater lake takes on an eerie glow in the darkness.Deceptively beautiful, it has a PH lower than that of battery acid- the largest acid lake on Earth, caustic enough to dissolve metal.

## TOURISM OR VOYEURISM

​	Considered a form of cultural heritage tourism, mine tours can be found around the world  from Africa to Australia.Unlike Mount Ijen, few are still active, and many have been museunified.

​	Some researchers propose tourists are attracted to these sites because they elicit what philosophers have termed the sublime a feeling of pleasure in seeing a dangerous but awe-inspiring object, like a violent act of nature.Victor Hugo defined it as a combination of the grotesque and beautiful as opposed to the classical ideal of perfection.

​	During high season, the mountain can see more than a thousand tourists per day. They often ask the miners to pose for photographs in exchange for small tips, what critics argue is a form of poverty tourism—the commodification of human suffering.

​	Tourists seem to relish narrating their tales of survival in apparently dangerous situations, an attitude not unlike that found towards other potentially hazardous receations and extreme sports, explains University of North Alababa geography professor Michael Pretes in the Annals of Tourism Research.

​	On the other hand, tourism can also be a powerful tool for economic development and expose unfavorable working canditions regardless of motivations for visiting. The tourism industry in East Java at large employs an region,and the workers are well-respected members of their communities .Many pride themselves on their physical fitness and role in attracting visitors to the island.

​	Tourists are seen as the new ore to be mined,and like metals , have the potential to provide economic booms as well as busts, according to Pretes, who studied the active sliver mines in Potosi, Bolivia.He argues that mining tourism can have a multiplier effect by bringing income to local hotels , restaurants, stores, transportation, and nearby historical sites.

​	Despite these potential advantaages, the risks remain high. Many miners can't afford protective equipment like gloves and masks ,or choose to forgo them because it hinders their work.Short-term exposure to highly concentrated levels of sulfur dioxide can be deadly,and chronic exposure can lead to breathing diffculties, airway obstructions, and impaired lung function, according to the Centers for Disease Control.

​	To prevent the objectification of people living in improverished conditions, ethical travel experts reccommend that tourists refrain from taking photographs solicit permission from the subjects being photographed.

# Why Are American Samoans Not US Citizens?

> If you are born in Guam or Puerto Rico,you are automatically granted citizenship.If you are born in American Samoa, that isn't the case.

​	The residents of American Samoa have a long tradition of voyaging to new lands as part of their ancestors' history.But in modern times, going beyond their five islands and two coral atolls in the South Pacific Ocean has often proven legally challenging.

​	Despite American Samoa's status as a US territory, the people who are born there aren't technically US citizens.They're called US nationals, a status that means they pay American taxes but cannot vote, run for office, or serve on a jury. They also have special passports that declare them nationals, but not US citizens.

​	This unusual status has prompted a group of American Samoans living in Utah to file a lawsuit, arguing that they should be considered US citizens under the 14th Amendment which grants citizenship at birth to anyone born in the US . The group says they face travel restrictions when they leave American Samoa, sometimes having to pay fees or obtain permits that US citizens don't need in order to travel , the Associated Press reports.

​	What makes this US territory differnet from the other four-the US Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands,Guam, and Puerto Rico-when it comes to citizenship?

​	It boils down to American Samoa's unincorportated status.In the early 20th century, the US couts defined territories as incorportated and unincorporated in order to divvy up the land that the US. received from the end of the Spanis American War. The justices who made those distinctions saw the people living in the unincorporated territories as uncivilized races and said that granting citizenship to them could be dangerous, in the group of rulings that bacame known as the Insular Cases.

​	Eventually, the other four territories listed above gained birthright citizenship through statutes, meaning people who are born there are automatically US. citizens. But because Samoa is the only territory still classified as unincorated, people who born there are only considered US citizens if they have a parent who is a US citizen.Otherwise, they have to go through the same lengthy, expensive naturalization process as any other person who isn't a citizen with no guarantee that it will be successful.

​	The lawsuit is the second such attempt within the past decade. The first, filed in 2012 was ultimately unsuccessful, with the Supreme Court ruling in 2015 that the 14th Amendment does not apply to overseas territories. The court decided not to reconsider that ruling when it was brought up again in 2016.

​	Leneuoti Tuaua, a former marshal for the High Court of American Samoa who holds two titles, was one of  seven American Samoans who filed the first lawsuit.Tuaus said American Samoans are treated differently whenever they travel abroad, even to places like independent Samoa the island country next door.

​	I want my children to have same world of opportunities available to them that are avaiable to any other child in any other part of the United States, Tuaus said in an editorial for Samoa News published in July 2012.I for on believe that our traditional leaders were right when they believed that US citizenship followed the American flag to our islands.

# Oil Spill Kills More Than 2400 Animals

> An unclear amount of oil has leaked into Colombia's waterways, and enviromental activists are saying an oil company is to blame

​	At the beginning of March, an oil well in northern Colombia burst, spewing an unclear amount of oil into the Megdalena River, a principal waterway that flows about 950 miles northward through the western half of the country. Over the next month, reports say the crude killed more than 2400 animals, including cattle, fish, birds, and reptiles,in the department of Santander. More than 1000 tree species in the area have been damaged, and familes have been relocated and treated for vomiting, headaches, and dizziness associated with the spill.

​	I have practically nothing to eat, we have lived throuhg the river all our lives and the contamination has already reached the Magdalena, one resident tells local media.

​	Conservationists say this environmental disaster is the worst the country has seen in decades, and the number of barrels spilled is unclear.Ecopetrol, the state-owned oil company that some environmental activists are blaming for the spill,says there were 550 barrels of crude spilled, but some local outlets are reporting that as many as 24000 barrels were spilled.

​	Although Ecopetrol says nearly 1250 animals have been rescued and the spill is under control, the crude continues to flow, locals say. So far, it's seeped about 15 miles to contaminate the Lizama and Sogamoso Rivers. An investigation of the cause of the leak is ongoing, and few details have been revealed.

​	Oil spills often have lasting effects, and the country has had other environmental problems . Last week, a report revealed that Colombia's Cauca River, which is south-west of the spill site, is unsafe for humans. According to the Cali-based newpaper EL Pais, carcinogenic heavy metals have been found in fish species eaten by humans.

​	Oil spills don't discriminate geographically.In 2013, a train carrying crude catastrophically derailed in Canada, killing people, destroying buildings, and of course,spewing oil.In 2010, the infamous Deepwater Horizon oil spill leaked more than 200 million gallons into the Gulf of Mexico, it the worst spill in US history.

​	The Colombia oil spill mirrors several that happened in Peru in 2016, which researcher and National Geographic Explorer Rebecca Wolff covered as an independent journalist. Some reports say that more than  450 local people sought medical attention for health problems related to oil contamination, but others likely suffered without treatment.

​	When oil spills happen, just coming into contact with oil in the short term has incredibly horrible side-effects, Wolff says.

​	Oil spills not only affect the flora and fauna of the environment, but farmland as well. Contaminated fields prevent locals from cultivating the land, and chemically poisoned fish—a protein packed dietary staple—must be taken out of the diet.

​	In addition to the symptoms reported by the Colombian locals, people suffering from oil contamination can experience respiratory issues,skin rashes, fatigue, and seemingly undiagnosted illnesses lasting months or years. Spill-related condictions can also kill children.

​	Wolff adds  that it can take days for local government to get involved right after a spill, so community members are often left to try to clean up their environment without adequate protection. Not enough studies have been done on the lasting consequences of oil spills, she says, since government intervention normally stops 60 days after the initial spill.

​	There is continual danger for years and years of what's in the fish and what's in the water, Wolff says. If you ruin the water and the land that people depend on , their livelihood is gone.

##HOPE FOR THE FUTURE

​	Local and international attention can shed light on oil spills and their consequences,ultimately helping conmunities recover over time.

​	Usually, people are just really angry or upset for a long time to come, Wolff says.She adds that cases locals brought to court about the Peruvian oil spills kind of sent the message to the country that people were not  OK with this.

​	She says long-term medical care and financial support are crucial for helping communites respond to these types of disasters,as are support and recognition from the goverment.

​	The world needs to pay better attention and have better response plans, Wolff says.all over the world , but I don't think we've come to a way to respond and support afterwards.

# A Running List of How Trump Is Changing the Environment

> The Trump administration has promised vast changes to US science and environmental policy-and we're tracking them here as they happen.

​	The Trump administration's tumultuous first year has brought a flurry of changes-both realized and anticipated to US environmental policy.Many of the actions roll back Obama-era policies that aimed to curb climate change and limit environmental pollution, while others threaten to limit federal funding for science and the environment.

​	It's a lot to keep track of , so National Geographic will be maintaining an abbreviated timeline of the Trump administration's environmental actions and policy changes , as well as reactions to them. We will update this article periodically as new develops.

	## EPA STARTS ROLLBACK OF CAR EMISSIONS STANDARDS

​	In a press release ,EPA administrator Scott Pruitt announced that the US  goverment would revisit the Obama administration's fuel effciency standards for cars and light-duty trucks-the first step in a  rollback of one the US biggest efforts to curb carbon emissions.

​	In July 2011, President Obama announced he would tighten regulations of vehicle greenhouse gas emissions, with rules that first finalized in August 2012.Under Obama fuel efficiencies equivalent to 545 miles per gallon by model year 2025

​	About a sixth of US greenhouse gas emissions in 2016 came from passenger cars and light-duty trucks. Overall , the Obama program would've reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 6 billion metric tons-more than the total CO the US emitted in 2016.

​	The EPA commited to finishing a midterm evaluation of the 2022–2025 standards by no later than April 1, 2018 .On January 12, 2017, outgoing Obama EPA administrator Gina MaCarthy finalized the evaluation and reaffirmed the stringent emissions standards.

​	At the time, car manufacturers argued that the 2022-2025 standards were unrealistic , expensive, and politically rushed.The Trump administration has enthusiastically echoed these sentiments; it restarted the midterm evaluation in March 2017.

​	The Obama administration's determination was wrong. Pruitt said in a statement.Obama 's EPA cut the Midterm Evaluation process short with politically charged expediency, made assumptions about the standards that didn't comport with reality, and set the standards too high.

​	Automakers struck a guardedly pleased tone in release about the announcement, seemingly leery that they be getting more rollbacks out of  the Trump EPA than they originaly bargained for.Already, environmental and public health groups are voicing fierce opposition.

​	Starting a process to weaken clean car standards marks yet another step backward from the fight to curb climate change, said Harold P Wimmer, the national president and CEO of the American Lung Association, in a statement.Climate change poses serious threats to millions of people, especially to some of the most vulnerable Americans , including children, older adults and those living with chronic disease as asthma.

# Why This Giant Crack Opened Up In Kenya

> The region has yielded a trover of archaeological finds in the past and may border a new continent 50 million years in the future.

​	Mai Mahiu-Narok road, in a region just west of Nairobi, Kenya,used to be fully intact.

​	Then, after a period of heavy rainful late last month, a massive crack was exposed . According to the local news outlet, Daily Nation,it measures 50 feet deep and 65 feet wide in some spots.

​	Geologist David Adede, who spoke with the paper , said the crack was likely filled previously with volcanic ash from nearby Mt. Longonot.This  means the  space was only exposed when rainwater washed the ash away.

​	Reuters reports that the opening formed rapidly. One resident named Eliud Njoroge Mbugua saw the crack run through his home. He was only narrowly able to collect some of his belongings before his house collapsed.

​	So what caused the break in the first place?

## GREAT RIFT

​	The crack, only recently exposed from its hiding place in the Earth, in part of the Great Rift Valley.

​	The name is often used to refer to a cultural region from the Middle East to Mozambiqeu,but is not actually connected to the same unit.Rather it's made of multiple rifts all running through the same system.

​	A rift valley refers to a lowland region where tectonic plates rift, or  move apart.The large crack that recently exposed itself in Kenya is from the East African Rift.In the 3700 mile-long East African Rift, there are two smaller systems called the Gregory Rift and the Western Rift, and each is speckled with volcanoes.

​	The rifts are growing larger as two tectonic plates, the Somali plate in the east and the Nubian plate in the west , move away from each other.

​	The region has yielded some of history's most important archaeological finds and has been nicknamed the cradle of humanity. Turkana boy. a 1.5 million year-old hominin skeleton was found there. It's an important piece of evidence for scientists piecing together our prehistoric past.

​	While it's one of the largest, the East African Rift isn't the only geological formation of its kind.Eastern Russia is home to the Baikal Rift Valley, and Antarctica is separated by the West Antarctic Rift.

​	In the US the southwest is sliced by the Rio Grande Rift Valley , which stretches from Chihuahua, Mexico to Colorado.It's formation, roughly 30 million years ago, is responsible for the Rio Grande River bordering the southern US.

# Go Beyond the Beach in Grenada

> The dramatic landscapes of this volcanic island in the Caribbean beg to be explored

​	While many area of the Caribbean are still recovering from 2017's devastating hurricanes, Grenada escaped any damage and is a hotter destination than ever. The former British colony boasts dramatic mountainous  landscapes and a rich spice-producing heritage.Here are the top five reasons to visit this volcanic isle.

## HISTORIC ST. GEORGE'S

​	Grenada's capital, founded by the French in 1650,is a charming jumble of stone buildings with colorful facades that rise along steep hills around the deep Inner Harbour. The imposing Catholic cathedral dominates the skyline, while the harbor waterfront, known as the Carenage is lined with restored George, a 300-year-old fortress with working cannons ,for 360-degree views of the city, harbor, and Caribbean Sea. For a unique underwater adventure , dive trips frequently depart St. George's for the Underwater Sculpture Garden in nearby Molinere Bay, where dozens of human figures in whimsical poses from a fascinating artificial reef that attracts a wide array of sealife.

## WINDWARD COAST

​	While tourists flock to hotspots such as Grand Anse Beach south of ST. George's, go off the beaten path to Grenada's rugged Atlantic coast. Back roads will bring you to hidden coves with golden beaches bare of footprints and coral reefs just offshore that are perfect for snorkeling. Stay at Cabier Ocean Lodge, an eco-friendly resort perched on a peninsula between two bays, where the soft roar of the waves sounds all night long. The on-site restaurant, Bruno's has a seaside terrace shaded by mango trees and serves up passionfruit mojitos and Grenadian favorites such as callaloo soup, a creamy soup made from the green leaves of the callaloo plant.

## WATERFALL SPLENDOR

​	Grenada is especiallly rich in waterfalls that tumble down its volcanic slopes. The highest is Royal Mount Carmel Falls, a spectacular cascade that pours 70 feet over a  sheer rock wall . Local guides lead visitors a trail through lush greenery that opens up to a breathtaking view of the falls. Don't forget to bring your swimsuit- a broad natural swimming pool at the base invites taking a dip, welcome after the hot jungle walk.

## SPICE ISLE

​	A British import in the 19th century, nutmeg trees flourished in Grenada's tropical climate, and the small island now produces almost a third of the world's supply of nutmeg.Cinnamon, cloves , mace, and ginger also exported, as well as organic Grenadian chololate that's grown and diectly produced from the island's many cacao farms. Spice naturally plays a large part in Grenadian cuisine—don't miss farms.Spice naturally plays a large part in Grenadian cuisine—don't miss trying nutmeg ice cream or nutmeg jelly —and even medicine. Hit up the Spice Market in ST George's for a vast array of spices, or travel farther afield to Grenville's local market, where you can find fresh ginger, coconuts, passionfruit, and blocks of chocolate.On the west side of the island, tour the Gouyave Nutmeg Station, where you can watch sorting and packaging.

# Famous Japanese Snow Monkeys Take Baths to Lower Stress

> Just like us, snow monkeys may cope with winter weather by taking warm baths, a new study found.

​	There's a reason macaques look so serene in their photos. Submerged up to their cheeks in steamy water with sonw drifting onto their furry heads-they look almost meditative.

​	Researchers always suspected the monkeys used the hot springs to stay warm in the winter, and a new study published in the journal Primates confirms this.While the researchers suspected this was the case, the finding could still illuminate how the monkeys cope with stress.

​	Of all the primates in the world, Japanese macaques live the farthest north.For decades , they've been observed taking baths in Jigokudani Monkey  Park in Japan. Their behavior has becom so endearing to people that thousands of tourists often trek north to take a peak at the snow monkeys' bath time.

​	In the mountainous regions of Japan, winters can be harsh. While the monkeys are lounging in a calm pool of water, they're often subjected to intense snowfall  and freezing temperatures. 

​	To see exactly what kind of  benefit the macaques got from their baths, a group of researchers from Japan's Kyoto University tracked 12 females. Their bahavior was observed in two different seasons: their birth season, from April to June, and their winter season, from October to December.The scientists looked at which monkeys bathed the most often and for how long.

​	They then measured the amount of a  hormone called glucocoricoid from the monkeys' fecal samples. Glucocoritcoids come from a family of steroid hormones and are produced when the monkeys undergo stress—ofen from trying to maintain a body temperature that's not too cold and not too hot.

## SOOTHING BATHS

​	The team's results confirmed that the monkeys used the hot springs more frequently during winter months. Females who had higher social standing were documented taking longer baths

​	When the researchers then measured the amount of glucocorticoid in females who took longer baths, they found lower levels of the stress hormone than in famales who hadn't bathed at all. This means the females experienced less stress from trying to regulate their body temperatures.

​	Whether the long baths influenced other stress hormones is unclear.Researchers plan to next study saliva samples to measure other hormones related to stress. They theorize that, by lowering stress, the baths could benefit the macaques' likelihood to reproduce and thus ensure their survival.

# Pakistan's Most Wild and Beautiful Places

> Journey from the Arabian Sea to the ivory cones of the Himalayas.

​	From the precipitous peaks of the Karakoram range to the fertile Indus River plain, Pakistan is home to a diversity of stunning landscapes . While its rich cultural heritage, ancient Silk Road, and ruins of Moenjo-daro continue to enchant travelers, wenture further afield and discover a lesser-known, wilder Pakistan.

## DEOSAI NATIONAL PARK

​	Known as Land of the Giants, a backdrop of snow-dusted mountains rises from the alpine plateau of Deosia National Park. Each spring, the lush valley is swept by wildflowers and rare butterflies, earning the name Summer's Places by locals, who enjoy the wildlife after winter's thaw. This biodiversity hot spot is home to the Tibetan wolf, Himalayan ibex, Tibetan red fox, and golden marmots, but the government granted the park protected status in 1993 with the goal of safeguarding the critically endangered Himalaan brown bear. The park was also nominated for World Heritage status in 2016.

## KAGHAN VALLEY

​	Northern Pakistan's picturesque Kaghan Valley is a place of fairytales.According to one version of a local legend, a prince of Persia fell in love with a fairy princess on the crystalline waters of Lake Saiful Muluk, pictured above. But a giant was also in love with the princess, and held her captive.One day , the prince escaped with her , and in his fury, the giant flooded the valley and created lakes with his tears.Today, visitors from around the world travel to Kaghan Valley for its alpine lakes, mountain scenery , and clear night skies.

## MAKRAN COAST

​	The Makran Coastal Highway is a scenic drive along Pakistan's Arabian Sea coast. The route starts in Karachi and runs through Gwadar to the Iran border, and is considered a major infrastuctual acheevement.Unique, lunar rock formations line a section of the highway known as the Buzi Pass in Hingol National Park. Natural rock sculptures, like the sphinx-shaped Lion of Balochistan, can be found along the highway.

## HUNZA

​	In the nothern territory of Gilgit- Baltistan , icy peaks stretch above the Hunza River. Situated on the riverbank and surrounded by glaciers and gorges, the town of Hunza traditionally served as a  resting place for  travelers descending the Hindu Kush mountains into the Vale of Kashmir. The valley is home to snow leopards , markhors, ibexes,and red-striped foxes.

## HINGOL NATIONAL PARK

​	Pakistan's largest national park extends hundreds of miles along the Makran Coast. While Hingol Naitonal Park is renowned for its diverse wildlife—Sindh leopards, chinkaras, honey badgers, and Indian pangolins—it is perhaps best known for its cluster of active mud volcanoes . A mix of hot spring activity, gas, and water react chemically with the surrounding rocks to form a boiling mud. When the mud is expelled, it continuously rebuilds the cones, which are easily eroded. One of the most famous mud volcanoes is Chandragup , a sacred annual pilgrimage site for thousands of Hindus , along with the nearby Hinlaj temple.

## BALTORO GLACIER

​	In Pakistan's eastern Karakoram, Baltoro Glacier is one of the world's largest valley glaciers. Though diffcult to access, it is one of the most highly trafficked regions in Pakistan because of mountaineering destinations like K2, Broad Peak, and the Gasherbrum peaks at its head. The area is not only known for its stunning scenery , but as a life source— a large protion northern Pakistan's population depends on meltwater from the Karakoram glaciers.

## NEELUM VALLEY

​	In northern Azad Kashmir, the bow-shaped Neelum Valley is sandwiched between 13000-foot peaks and blanketed by verdant forest and streams.The small hilltop village of Arang Kel, pictured above,is known as the pearl of Neelum Valley.

## ATTABAD LAKE

​	Nestled in the Hunnza Valley, attabad Lake's vibrant turquoise waters cut through the rocky terrain. Though beautiful, the serene landscape has a violent origin story. The lake was formed in January 2010,when a massive landslide at Attabad Village flooded nearby towns, blocked the flow of the Hunza River, and displaced thousands of people . Today , it's a popular stop for tourists who can take boats out on the water.

# Luxury Space Hotel Could Cater Travelers by 2022

> Soon after launch in 2021, the startup Orion Span hopes to send up extraterrestrial condos to capialize on open space.

​	With all the madness going on here on Earth, have you ever thought about going into space? Well , for a couple million dollars, you might be able check off that bucket list-worthy to-do in the next four years.

​	Orion Span, a Houston-based space tech startup, has announced plans to launch the first-ever luxury space hotel into Earth's orbit by 2021. The company says the so-called Aurora Station will be ready to accommodate visitors the following year.

​	The price of a ticket for a 12-day stay will be 9.5 million per person, which comes to 7898 per night.

## NOT YOUR AVERAGE SPACE STAY

​	Orion Span has yet to contract with a launch provider to put future visitors—and the station—into orbit. In the past, private citizens have been seen to the International Space Station on 20 to 40 million round-trip tickets, but according to Frank Bunger, the company's founder and CEO, Orion Span's trips are less expensive because of declining launch prices. Right now, prospective flyers can put down an 8000 refundable deposit for future stays.

​	Upon launch, Aurora Station goes into service immediately, bringing travelers into space quicker and a lower price point than ever seen before, Bunger says in a statement . Our goal is to make space accessible to all, by continuing to driver greater value at a lower cost.

​	The hotel, which is slated for  launch into low Earth orbit at around 200 miles from the Earth's surface, will be about the size of the cabin of a large private jet. Company representatives say it will be roughly 43 feet long by 14 feet wide, with a pressurized volume of 5650 cubic feet. By comparison , the ISS in much larger, at 357 feet long , an internal pressurized volume of 3223 cubic feet, and soars 250 miles above Earth .

​	Completed,Aurora Station will be fully modular and  host six people at a time with private, two-person suites. Four of those people will be guests and two will be crewmembers who are most likely former astronauts, the company says. With the help of engineers who have worked on the ISS , the hotel is currently in construction in Housten,while Orion Span develops software for it in the Bay Area.
