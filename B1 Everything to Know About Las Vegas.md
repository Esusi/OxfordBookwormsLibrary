# Dramatic Photos Show How Sand Mining Threatens a Way of Life in Southeast Asia

> In An Giang Province, Vietnam, a half-mile stretch of riverfront along the Van River collapsed in April 2017, plunging houses and part of the road the river. Sand mining had weakened the bank

One afternoon last year, Ha Thi Be 67, was siting with her son in her tiny coffee shop in the town of Hong Ngu, looking out on the lazy Tien River, the main branch of the Mekong in Vietnam, Suddenly, the ground beneath them gave way. The river bank was crumbing into the water. We shouted out loud and ran, she says. It srashed with a huge sound, boom, boom.

Be and her son escaped unharmed, but the  coffee shop and her nearby house were destroyed. It took all of what we owned to build the house, and now it's all gone, she sighes. Still, Be counts herself luncky. If it had happened at night, I and my grand would have died. We used to sleep in that house, she says.

​	The main causes of the collapse can be seen floating in many places on the Tien's murky waters dredging boats , using rackety pumps to raise from the river bed enormous quantities of sand. In recent years,that humble substance has become an stonishingly hot commodity. Sand is a key ingredient in concrete, the essential building material of Vietnam's fast-growing cities. Demand for it is surging  and that is wreaking havoc not only on Vietnam's rivers, but also on the all important Mekong Delta. (Read about the damming of the Mekong in the magazine)

> Left:Ha Thi Be and her two grandsons stand in the ruins of her ancestral home along the Tien River in Dong Thap Province. The goverment warned her to relocate inland to live with her son in January 2017, two months before the house eventually collapsed.But everything I own was in this house, and now everything is gone, she said.

> Right:In July 2017 Ba Tu 72,returned to what's left of her house in Nha Be, a suburb of Ho Chi Minh CIty. Four days earlier, part of the house had fallen into the river. Ba Tu was home with her daughter-in-law when it happened, but both women escaped injury.

In towns and villages all along the Mekong River and many other rivers around the country, banks undermined by dredging are collapsing into the water, taking with them farm fields,fish ponds ,shops and homes. Inrecent years, thousands of acres of rice farms have been lost, and at least 1200 families have had to be relocated. Hundreds more have evacaated in-stream islands that were literally disappearing beneath their feet. Goverment offcials estimate some 50000 people in the Mekong Delta area alone need to be moved out of such landslide zones.

​	River sand mining isn't only a problem for people: It also muddies waters and scours riverbeds, killin gthe fish, plants ,and other organisms that live there. When I was a child, we'd catch fish and snails to eat, Recalls Ha Thi Be. Since the sand dredges came, the fish and snails are no more.

## A Globle Problem

Vietnam is far from the only place where sand mining is inflicting such damage.All over the developing world, cities are growing at a furious pace, devouring sand in unprecedented quantities. The unmber of Vietnamese living in cities has double in the last twenty years, to some 32 million. Worldwide, the urban population is risin gby about 65 million people annually; that's the equivalent of adding eight New York Cites to the planet every single year. Nearly 50 billion tons of sand and gravel is extracted anually to create all the concrete office towers , apartment blocks, highways, and airports those people need. (Some Vietnamese sand is also sold to nearby Singapore, which uses gargantuan amounts to build artificial land)

Why,you might ask, don't we simply mine sand from the Sahara and other deserts? The answer is desert sand doesn't work in concrete the wind eroded grains are too smooth and rounded. As a result, from China to Jamaica, from Liberia to India,sand miners are plundering riverbeds, floodplains,and beaches for the preciou grains.

# Once Written Off for Dead, the Aral Sea Is Now Full of Life

Omirserik Ibragimov fixed his gaze on the hole he had carved out from the Aral Sea. The 25-year-old's hands moved steadily , pulling out a fishing net that he and father had left under the solid, snow-covered surface just three days earlier.

​	After a minute marked by tense silence, two breams emerged from the hole. Then three pike-perches , their silver scales shimmering as they struggled against the net's green meshing.

​	Here comes the gold, Omirserik said with a smile as he continued tugging the net. The pike-perch,with its tender flesh and few bones, is considered to be the most valuable catch, selling for roughly 650 tenge(a little over 2) for a kilogram; local fishermen refer to them as gold fish.

His father ,Kidirbai,worked with his bare hands to free the fish, his knuckles flush from the freezing water. After gathering all their nets, their total catch of the day was about 77 pounds of pike-perch and 44 pounds of bream a sizable haul for a few hours of work.

Just 15 years earlier, this would not have been possible. Once the world's fourth-largest freshwater lake,with an area of some 26000 square miles, the Aral Sea became the victim of the Soviet Union's agricultural policies in the 1950s.Water from its two river sources the Amu Darya and Syr Darya was intentionally diverted for cotton cultivation.

As decreasing water flow into the sea caused a rise in salinity, the abundant freshwater fish species began to die out. By the 1980s, the fishing industry in the Aralsk district once a robust source of employment for the region was wiped out , forcing a mass migration of people. The remaining population was hit by extreme weather, brought on by the dired-out Aral seabed, and deteriorating health.

The people destroyed the sea and then nature took revenge on the people, said Madi Zhasekenow, the director of the Aralsk Regional Museum and Fishermen Museum.

## MASSIVE DISASTER

This repid collapse over less than three decades which environmental scientists say is one of the planet's worst ecological disasters is marked today by the sea's reduced size. Its total area of water, straddling Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan , is now a tenth of its original size. What's left has broken into two distinct bodies: the North and South Aral Seas. In Uzbekistan, the entire eastern basin of the South Aral Sea is completely desiccated, leaving merely a single strip of water in the west.(Learn about other vanishing lakes around the world)

But Kazakhstan's North Aral Sea has seen a happier outcome,thanks to a nearly 86 million project financed in large part by the World Bank. Along with repairs to existing dikes around the basin to prevent spillage, an eight-mile dam was constructed just south of the Syr Darya River. Completed in the summer of 2005,this dam, named Kokaral, surpassed all expectations.It led to an 11 foot increase in water levels after just seven months a goal that scientists initially expected would take three years.

This turnarouond in the North Aral Sea's fate has meant that the fish stocks have returned to its waters, injecting new life into the local communities. Just as goverment policies had doomed the Aral Sea, careful planning and research helped revive at least part of it.\

Kristopher White, a researcher and professor of Almaty's KIMEP University who has studied the  economic impacts of the Aral Sea's desiccation,explained that while the sea will never return to its former size, the 18 percent increase in mass of the North Aral Sea is a testament to how political will and scientific research can benefit the environment.

Anthropogenic ecological damage can be reversed by human interventions, said White.

## OPTIMISM AND HOPE

At its peak in 1957, the Aral Sea produced more than 48 tons of fish, representing roughly 13 percent of the Soviet Union's fish stocks. By the 1980s, due to the rising salinity of the sea, the 20 native species of fish were decimated; coommercial harvests plummeted to zero 1987.The water from the sea receded, and today, the shore is about 12 miles(20 kilomietres )from Aralsk.

​	The major source of employment was gone, and with it optimism and hope for the future, said White. And that really prevailed throughout the region until the completion of this dam.

During those decades, flounder was the only fish that could survive the high-salinity North Aral Sea. But after the Kokaral Dam was finished, the average salinity dropped from 30 grams to 8 grams per  liter, prompting the return of almost two dozen freshwater species through the Syr Darya river.

​	According to the Aralsk Fish Inspection Unit, fish catch in the North Aral Sea has grown six-fold since 2006, when the bulk of the 1360 tons caught was flounder. By 2016 tons of fish was caught, with bream being the most common, followed by roach and the sought-after pike-pech. For 2018, the fishing limit is set at 8200 tons,said head inspector Esenbai Ensepov.
