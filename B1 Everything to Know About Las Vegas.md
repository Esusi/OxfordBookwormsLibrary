# B1 Everything to Know About Las Vegas

​	Every cliche about America is blow up in Las Vegas, blared from the neon horizon. Rightly so,as the city delivers more glitz and activity than can rightly fit in one average day. But reinvention is in its DNA, from the Gold Rush to the mafia era and ties to Cuba. Now the downtown area, under development by Zappos founder Tony Hsieh, is an attempt to develop a new normal with hipster bars, a burgeoning gallery scene and recreation park made of storage containers. LIke the buffets, there's something for everyone.

​	WHEN TO GO

Spring and fall are the ideal times to go to Sin City. Summer is really , really hot, but with all the pools and air-conditioning, the desert heat isn't really a deterrent.

​	CELEBRATE

The Life is Beautiful Festival is worth plannng around if you like more than 12000 people for three days of music ,art,talks, and culinary delights . If electrnic music is more your speed, Electric Daisy Carnival is godmother of EDM festivals. If you're looking for a more rustic experience, check out the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo fro cowboys and country music in December.

​	WHAT TO EAT

Buffets! If there's one food form Sin City has perfected, it's the all-you-can-eat mountains of food in queues. It's everything you want, when you want it, from fried food to haute cuisine and let's never forget desserts. Remember, more is more, and it's always available.

​	INSTAGRAM-WOTHEY VIEW

The Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign says it all. For the best lighting, take your photos at sunset.

​	SUSTAINABLE TRAVEL TIP

Take the Monorail or buses or walk the Strip. It's also possible to travel on foot almost entirel indoors, because of the connections between the buildings to beat the heat.

​	SOUVENIR TO TAKE HOME

Should you cash in your casino chips, you can buy some real estate, or at least Monopoly: The Las Vegas Edition. For something tastier, what about an Elvis PEZ candy roll dispenser or other such candy? There's also the Ethel M ,of the candy empire  chocolate factory and cactus botanical garden (largest in the southwest) in Henderson.After watching chocolate getting made, take some home. If all else fails, there's always fuzzy dice. After all, not everyone leaves with a marriage license.

# Dramatic Photos Show How Sand Mining Threatens a Way of Life in Southeast Asia

> In An Giang Province, Vietnam, a half-mile stretch of riverfront along the Van River collapsed in April 2017, plunging houses and part of the road the river. Sand mining had weakened the bank

One afternoon last year, Ha Thi Be 67, was siting with her son in her tiny coffee shop in the town of Hong Ngu, looking out on the lazy Tien River, the main branch of the Mekong in Vietnam, Suddenly, the ground beneath them gave way. The river bank was crumbing into the water. We shouted out loud and ran, she says. It srashed with a huge sound, boom, boom.

Be and her son escaped unharmed, but the  coffee shop and her nearby house were destroyed. It took all of what we owned to build the house, and now it's all gone, she sighes. Still, Be counts herself luncky. If it had happened at night, I and my grand would have died. We used to sleep in that house, she says.

​	The main causes of the collapse can be seen floating in many places on the Tien's murky waters dredging boats , using rackety pumps to raise from the river bed enormous quantities of sand. In recent years,that humble substance has become an stonishingly hot commodity. Sand is a key ingredient in concrete, the essential building material of Vietnam's fast-growing cities. Demand for it is surging  and that is wreaking havoc not only on Vietnam's rivers, but also on the all important Mekong Delta. (Read about the damming of the Mekong in the magazine)

> Left:Ha Thi Be and her two grandsons stand in the ruins of her ancestral home along the Tien River in Dong Thap Province. The goverment warned her to relocate inland to live with her son in January 2017, two months before the house eventually collapsed.But everything I own was in this house, and now everything is gone, she said. 
>
> Right:In July 2017 Ba Tu 72,returned to what's left of her house in Nha Be, a suburb of Ho Chi Minh CIty. Four days earlier, part of the house had fallen into the river. Ba Tu was home with her daughter-in-law when it happened, but both women escaped injury.

In towns and villages all along the Mekong River and many other rivers around the country, banks undermined by dredging are collapsing into the water, taking with them farm fields,fish ponds ,shops and homes. Inrecent years, thousands of acres of rice farms have been lost, and at least 1200 families have had to be relocated. Hundreds more have evacaated in-stream islands that were literally disappearing beneath their feet. Goverment offcials estimate some 50000 people in the Mekong Delta area alone need to be moved out of such landslide zones.

​	River sand mining isn't only a problem for people: It also muddies waters and scours riverbeds, killin gthe fish, plants ,and other organisms that live there. When I was a child, we'd catch fish and snails to eat, Recalls Ha Thi Be. Since the sand dredges came, the fish and snails are no more.

## A Globle Problem

Vietnam is far from the only place where sand mining is inflicting such damage.All over the developing world, cities are growing at a furious pace, devouring sand in unprecedented quantities. The unmber of Vietnamese living in cities has double in the last twenty years, to some 32 million. Worldwide, the urban population is risin gby about 65 million people annually; that's the equivalent of adding eight New York Cites to the planet every single year. Nearly 50 billion tons of sand and gravel is extracted anually to create all the concrete office towers , apartment blocks, highways, and airports those people need. (Some Vietnamese sand is also sold to nearby Singapore, which uses gargantuan amounts to build artificial land)

Why,you might ask, don't we simply mine sand from the Sahara and other deserts? The answer is desert sand doesn't work in concrete the wind eroded grains are too smooth and rounded. As a result, from China to Jamaica, from Liberia to India,sand miners are plundering riverbeds, floodplains,and beaches for the preciou grains.

# Once Written Off for Dead, the Aral Sea Is Now Full of Life

Omirserik Ibragimov fixed his gaze on the hole he had carved out from the Aral Sea. The 25-year-old's hands moved steadily , pulling out a fishing net that he and father had left under the solid, snow-covered surface just three days earlier.

​	After a minute marked by tense silence, two breams emerged from the hole. Then three pike-perches , their silver scales shimmering as they struggled against the net's green meshing.

​	Here comes the gold, Omirserik said with a smile as he continued tugging the net. The pike-perch,with its tender flesh and few bones, is considered to be the most valuable catch, selling for roughly 650 tenge(a little over 2) for a kilogram; local fishermen refer to them as gold fish.

His father ,Kidirbai,worked with his bare hands to free the fish, his knuckles flush from the freezing water. After gathering all their nets, their total catch of the day was about 77 pounds of pike-perch and 44 pounds of bream a sizable haul for a few hours of work.

Just 15 years earlier, this would not have been possible. Once the world's fourth-largest freshwater lake,with an area of some 26000 square miles, the Aral Sea became the victim of the Soviet Union's agricultural policies in the 1950s.Water from its two river sources the Amu Darya and Syr Darya was intentionally diverted for cotton cultivation.

As decreasing water flow into the sea caused a rise in salinity, the abundant freshwater fish species began to die out. By the 1980s, the fishing industry in the Aralsk district once a robust source of employment for the region was wiped out , forcing a mass migration of people. The remaining population was hit by extreme weather, brought on by the dired-out Aral seabed, and deteriorating health.

The people destroyed the sea and then nature took revenge on the people, said Madi Zhasekenow, the director of the Aralsk Regional Museum and Fishermen Museum.

## MASSIVE DISASTER

This repid collapse over less than three decades which environmental scientists say is one of the planet's worst ecological disasters is marked today by the sea's reduced size. Its total area of water, straddling Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan , is now a tenth of its original size. What's left has broken into two distinct bodies: the North and South Aral Seas. In Uzbekistan, the entire eastern basin of the South Aral Sea is completely desiccated, leaving merely a single strip of water in the west.(Learn about other vanishing lakes around the world)

But Kazakhstan's North Aral Sea has seen a happier outcome,thanks to a nearly 86 million project financed in large part by the World Bank. Along with repairs to existing dikes around the basin to prevent spillage, an eight-mile dam was constructed just south of the Syr Darya River. Completed in the summer of 2005,this dam, named Kokaral, surpassed all expectations.It led to an 11 foot increase in water levels after just seven months a goal that scientists initially expected would take three years.

This turnarouond in the North Aral Sea's fate has meant that the fish stocks have returned to its waters, injecting new life into the local communities. Just as goverment policies had doomed the Aral Sea, careful planning and research helped revive at least part of it.\

Kristopher White, a researcher and professor of Almaty's KIMEP University who has studied the  economic impacts of the Aral Sea's desiccation,explained that while the sea will never return to its former size, the 18 percent increase in mass of the North Aral Sea is a testament to how political will and scientific research can benefit the environment.

Anthropogenic ecological damage can be reversed by human interventions, said White.

## OPTIMISM AND HOPE

At its peak in 1957, the Aral Sea produced more than 48 tons of fish, representing roughly 13 percent of the Soviet Union's fish stocks. By the 1980s, due to the rising salinity of the sea, the 20 native species of fish were decimated; coommercial harvests plummeted to zero 1987.The water from the sea receded, and today, the shore is about 12 miles(20 kilomietres )from Aralsk.

​	The major source of employment was gone, and with it optimism and hope for the future, said White. And that really prevailed throughout the region until the completion of this dam.

During those decades, flounder was the only fish that could survive the high-salinity North Aral Sea. But after the Kokaral Dam was finished, the average salinity dropped from 30 grams to 8 grams per  liter, prompting the return of almost two dozen freshwater species through the Syr Darya river.

​	According to the Aralsk Fish Inspection Unit, fish catch in the North Aral Sea has grown six-fold since 2006, when the bulk of the 1360 tons caught was flounder. By 2016 tons of fish was caught, with bream being the most common, followed by roach and the sought-after pike-pech. For 2018, the fishing limit is set at 8200 tons,said head inspector Esenbai Ensepov.

# 10 Strange Things You(Probably)Didn't Know About Earth

The planet we all call hom is even more bizarre than you might imagine.

​	There's no doubt that planet Earth is awe-inspiring. That's even more true for the handful of humans who've seen it from space with their own eyes.

​	We tend to think of ourselves as a weird,tiny little human being on a very large, powerful planet, and there clearly irrelevant to anything that might affect the planet at a planetary scale, says former NASA astronaut Kathryn Sullivan, who in 1984 bacame the first US woman to walk in space.In some ways that's true. But if you step back and look at the planet in total, you see how richly interconnected and interwined all the actual systems are.

​	Even with all its magnificence and majesty, Earth is also just kind of strange.Aside from the fact that it's the only planet known(so far) to support lefe, it has a bunch of inherent quirks, from geophysical weirdness to the landscapes adorning its surface to the organisms it supports. And the  more we learn about Earth's peculiarities, the more we grow to appreciate and treasure its many wonders-starting with the air we breathe.

​	You look back at the Earth and that huge majestic ocean, the atmosphere is a lot more like the fuzz on a tennis ball than some big massive thing, Sullivan says. It's like the wall of a soap bubble, this littlt membrane that envelops this grain of rock and is the reason that critters like us can live.

​	Here are some of the oddest things about this gas-shrouded ball of water and rock we call home.

## The Planet's Poles Flip

​	We all know that North is, well,north—somewhere above Alaska-and south is down near the middle of Antarctica. That will always be true for the planet's geographic poles, but it's only intermittently true for the planet's magnetic poles. Over the past 20 million years, the magnetic poles have flip-flopped every several hundred years or so, which means that if you had a compass in hand about 800000 years ago, it  would tell you that north was in Antarctica.

​	Though scientists are pretty sure Earth's churning, molten iron core powers these polar acrobatics, it's not entirely clear what triggers the actual reversals.The process is gradual and occure over millenia, For now, Earth's north magnetic pole is creeping northward by about 40 miles a year.And given that the last major pole reversal happened 78000 years ago, we are overdue for a flip.

	## It Has a Supersized Moon

Sunday evening marked the most recent rising of the supermoon, but regardless of how large Earth's moon appears in the sky on any given night, it's always among the solar system's most overgrown satellites.Relative to Earth, it's positively enormous, coming in at a quarter as wide as our home planet.

​	The only celestial twosome that bests Earth-moon team in this regard is Pluto and its biggest moon Charon,which really from more of a binary system- a pair of objects twirling around each other—rather than a typical planet moon pair. And thank goodness the moon is so big and so close. If it were smaller or farther away, we would never see total solar eclipses.

## The Biggest Mammal Migration Is Airborne

Yep,you may have thought the 1.3 million wildbeest that hoof their way between Kenya and Tanzania were tops, but you'd be wrong.

​	Millions and millions of bats-giant  fruit bast, to be exact-fly between teh Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia's Kasanka National Park each year.With more than 10 million of these cat-size, mango-munching, echolocating chiropterans involved, it's the largest known mammal migration on Earth.

# This Tiny Beetle Is Devastating Forests In the Worst Outbreak Ever

​	Despite being smaller than a grain of rice, mountain pine beetles are causing big problems for pine forests across North America.Bark beetle colonies feed and reproduce on the inner bark of ponderosa and limber pines, wreaking deadly havoc on the tree's ability to circulate nutrients and absorb water. Due to changes in climate and other factors, the recent outbreak of these destructive insects has reached proportions never before seen in recorded history.Alarming estimates from the US Forest Service state that 100 beetle-infested trees fall daily across the United States.

​	To combat this epidemic, Professor Diana Six has made it her mission to crack the genetic code of the pine tree. She hopes that studying the relationship between the mountain pine beetle and the trees they kill will provide us with valuable insight into the future of our forests.In this short film made at the International Wildlife Film Festival Filmmaker Labs, Professor Six walks among the trees and shares her thoughts on why humans can do more to conuteract the effects of climate change.

# Why the Brain-Body Connection Is More important Than We Think

​	Our brains aren't flying solo; our emotions also come into play when we're interacting with the world, new research finds.

​	The idea that our brains are like giant supercomputers, orchestrating and determining everything we do, has gained ground in recent years. So too have ideas that a short time ago would have been regarded as science fiction, like downloading the Internet directly to our brains, or creating a new kind of human, one with enhanced cognitive powers.

​	In his new book, The Biological Mind, Alan Jasanoff,professor of biological engineering at MIT, explains why this cerebral mystique creates a false dichotomy between the brain and the body and ignores bodily influences on our psychology,from chemicals in the blood to bacteria in the gut.

​	Speaking from his office at MIT, he explained why Red Sox legend Ted Williams has his body frozen;why changes in temperature influence how much Dutch police shoot their guns; and why the idea of downloading the Internet directly into our brains is not a good one.

# One of the underlying concepts in your book is what you call the cerebral mystique.Can you explain what it means and why this view of the brain is distorting our real natures?

​	This book is largely about two  opposite ideas:the biological mind centered on the brain, in which influences from the rest of  the body and outside the body shape what we think and do, and the cerebral mystique, a complex of  sterotyper and ideals about the brain, which tend to treat it as an isolated and all-powerful entity,almost like a modern version of th soul.

​	The problem with having a dualistic view of the brain and its relationship to the physical body, and the physical world, is that it makes us see ourselves as unnaturaly self-contained, both as minds and as autonomous agents. In other words, we view ourselves as things that operate from within, so we're less sensitive to things that influence us on the outside. The idea that the brain is a machine, an abstract entity like a giant supercomputer, has been around for a  while, basically since computers. Other people have used a quantum analogy for the brain. But the idea of the brain as a computer is the most common in this day and age.

# New research suggsts that our emotions, as much as our brains, are key in mediating how we perceive and interact with the world. Tell us about Lauri Nummenmaa's study.

Yes! People have at various times in history been sensitized to the ways the body and brain coordinate emotions. A fascinating study published a few years ago asked participants to map, on pictures of their own body, where they feel sensations as they experience different emotions. The investigators looked at something like 15 variegated emotions and found different bodily maps for each of those things. The first group of participants was Finnish.To test for cultural biases, they looked at a second group, I think Japanese, and found similar responese.

​	Probably the most famous person who has advocated the view  that emotions are key to learning or behavior is Daniel Kahneman. His studies showed that there's this apparently repid, irrational, shoot-from -the-hip way to make decisions, which is important in the behaviroal side of economics. In our field in neuroscience, Antonio Damasio has argued for many  years that there's a loop between the body and the brain. This involves bodily signatures that get tied to different contexts in our enviroment, and steer us towards different behavioral outcomes. This is one way in which the body is cognitively involved in our actions, in a way many people wouldn't believe when confronted with the more mystical view of the  brain as a self-contained machine.

# A new area of neuroscience known as connectomics seeks to give a kind of unifying theory of the brain.Explain what it means, and what the Human Connectome Project is doing

​	Connectiomics means two differnet things in our community.The one I personally interact with is more about mapping the individual's structures, chiefly cells in the brain. The Human Connectome Project is a bit different because it looks, at roughly three orders of magnitude lower resolution, at the superhighways that connect different regions of the brain and tries to relate those to aspects of brain activity and genetics. What both these views have in common is that they're trying to describe key aspects of brain funciton in terms of its intrinsic structure.

# Find Bliss in This Stunning Floral Kingdom

> Whether exporing these unique flowers in the wild, or touring the Kirstenbosch botanical gardens, teh rare flora in this kingdom is sure to impress.

​	Many travelers visit South Africa to see the Big Five animals, soak in the views from Table Mountain, or relax on a beach where two oceans meet-essential experiences in this multicultureal nation. There is so much to offer in South Africa, that one of its most unique qualities can sometimes go overlooked. The world is divided into six Floral Kingdoms, also called Floristic Regions. South Africa is home to the smallest-by far- and most unique Floral Kingdom, as designated by plant geographers. Thirty percent of the plant genera in South Africa's Cape Floristice Regions are found nowhere else in the world.

​	Here are five ways to experience the unique flora of the fynbos,or fine bush, in this UNESCO World Heritage site all within a day's drive from Cape Town.

​	On the edge of bustling Cape Town, find yourself in a colorful, kaleidoscopic escape. The 1300-acre garden is expansive and beautifully organized. Get lost in the hills of color, follow a detailed map, or join a free walking tour(after paying the five dollar entry fee). The garden is also home to frequent music and movie events on summer evenings. And not to be missed o a clear day is the Boomslang Tree Canopy Walkway, a steel and timber bredge that winds(like a boomslang ,or tree snake)through the canopy providing aerial views of the gardens and Table Mountain.

​	From most areas in Cape Town it is hard to miss the New7 Wonder of Nature that is Table Mountain. A cable car can take you up and down the mountain should you choose to skip a hike, just be sure to check the site frequently for weather and wait time updates. Table Mountain National Park boasts more plant species than all of New Zealand, so hiking , expecially with a guide or  naturalist, will give you the opportunity to truly experience the unparalleled diversity.  Consult with a guide company like Hike Table Mountain to find which of the hundreds of possible routes is best for you.

# The Giant Squid Nebula and More Animals of the Cosmos

> As galixies collide and new stars are born, spectacular shapes form in the universe-and many of them resumble Earthly creatures.

​	If you can't get enough of the animals here on Earth, just look forward the heavens.There you will find eagles,elephants,whals,and more-as long as you have a powerful telescope and an even more powerful imagination.

​	Astronomers have long named galaxies, nebulae, and other astronomical phenomena for the animals they resemble when observed from Earth.Now these animal look-alikes, comprised of starts and stardust,number in the dozons.Nebulae alone,for example,represent at least 20 example at 20 animals,from giant squid to running chickens.

​	These are the objects that really capture people's imaginations,says Karen Masters,associate professor of astronomy at Haverford Collage.It's human nature to see familiar things in the unfamiliar,(See an epic picture that shows thousands of galaxies in one frame)

​	And to early observers,these phenomena were indeed unfamiliar.Nebulae are cosmic clouds of gas and dust, linked to the birth or death of starts,whereas galaxies are ensembles of millions or billions of starts bound together by gravity.

​	Animal names, like Mice Galaxies,have been used for years-and in some cases, centuries.But they're not actually offcial, says Thierry Montmerle, former General Secretry of the International Astronomical Union,which oversees the naming of astronomical objects.

​	It's very informal, he says.The name is adopted by popular demand,and the LAU is perfectly happy with that.
