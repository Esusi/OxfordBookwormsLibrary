# B1 Everything to Know About Las Vegas

​	Every cliche about America is blow up in Las Vegas, blared from the neon horizon. Rightly so,as the city delivers more glitz and activity than can rightly fit in one average day. But reinvention is in its DNA, from the Gold Rush to the mafia era and ties to Cuba. Now the downtown area, under development by Zappos founder Tony Hsieh, is an attempt to develop a new normal with hipster bars, a burgeoning gallery scene and recreation park made of storage containers. LIke the buffets, there's something for everyone.

​	WHEN TO GO

Spring and fall are the ideal times to go to Sin City. Summer is really , really hot, but with all the pools and air-conditioning, the desert heat isn't really a deterrent.

​	CELEBRATE

The Life is Beautiful Festival is worth plannng around if you like more than 12000 people for three days of music ,art,talks, and culinary delights . If electrnic music is more your speed, Electric Daisy Carnival is godmother of EDM festivals. If you're looking for a more rustic experience, check out the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo fro cowboys and country music in December.

​	WHAT TO EAT

Buffets! If there's one food form Sin City has perfected, it's the all-you-can-eat mountains of food in queues. It's everything you want, when you want it, from fried food to haute cuisine and let's never forget desserts. Remember, more is more, and it's always available.

​	INSTAGRAM-WOTHEY VIEW

The Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign says it all. For the best lighting, take your photos at sunset.

​	SUSTAINABLE TRAVEL TIP

Take the Monorail or buses or walk the Strip. It's also possible to travel on foot almost entirel indoors, because of the connections between the buildings to beat the heat.

​	SOUVENIR TO TAKE HOME

Should you cash in your casino chips, you can buy some real estate, or at least Monopoly: The Las Vegas Edition. For something tastier, what about an Elvis PEZ candy roll dispenser or other such candy? There's also the Ethel M ,of the candy empire  chocolate factory and cactus botanical garden (largest in the southwest) in Henderson.After watching chocolate getting made, take some home. If all else fails, there's always fuzzy dice. After all, not everyone leaves with a marriage license.

# Dramatic Photos Show How Sand Mining Threatens a Way of Life in Southeast Asia

> In An Giang Province, Vietnam, a half-mile stretch of riverfront along the Van River collapsed in April 2017, plunging houses and part of the road the river. Sand mining had weakened the bank

One afternoon last year, Ha Thi Be 67, was siting with her son in her tiny coffee shop in the town of Hong Ngu, looking out on the lazy Tien River, the main branch of the Mekong in Vietnam, Suddenly, the ground beneath them gave way. The river bank was crumbing into the water. We shouted out loud and ran, she says. It srashed with a huge sound, boom, boom.

Be and her son escaped unharmed, but the  coffee shop and her nearby house were destroyed. It took all of what we owned to build the house, and now it's all gone, she sighes. Still, Be counts herself luncky. If it had happened at night, I and my grand would have died. We used to sleep in that house, she says.

​	The main causes of the collapse can be seen floating in many places on the Tien's murky waters dredging boats , using rackety pumps to raise from the river bed enormous quantities of sand. In recent years,that humble substance has become an stonishingly hot commodity. Sand is a key ingredient in concrete, the essential building material of Vietnam's fast-growing cities. Demand for it is surging  and that is wreaking havoc not only on Vietnam's rivers, but also on the all important Mekong Delta. (Read about the damming of the Mekong in the magazine)

> Left:Ha Thi Be and her two grandsons stand in the ruins of her ancestral home along the Tien River in Dong Thap Province. The goverment warned her to relocate inland to live with her son in January 2017, two months before the house eventually collapsed.But everything I own was in this house, and now everything is gone, she said. 
>
> Right:In July 2017 Ba Tu 72,returned to what's left of her house in Nha Be, a suburb of Ho Chi Minh CIty. Four days earlier, part of the house had fallen into the river. Ba Tu was home with her daughter-in-law when it happened, but both women escaped injury.

In towns and villages all along the Mekong River and many other rivers around the country, banks undermined by dredging are collapsing into the water, taking with them farm fields,fish ponds ,shops and homes. Inrecent years, thousands of acres of rice farms have been lost, and at least 1200 families have had to be relocated. Hundreds more have evacaated in-stream islands that were literally disappearing beneath their feet. Goverment offcials estimate some 50000 people in the Mekong Delta area alone need to be moved out of such landslide zones.

​	River sand mining isn't only a problem for people: It also muddies waters and scours riverbeds, killin gthe fish, plants ,and other organisms that live there. When I was a child, we'd catch fish and snails to eat, Recalls Ha Thi Be. Since the sand dredges came, the fish and snails are no more.

## A Globle Problem

Vietnam is far from the only place where sand mining is inflicting such damage.All over the developing world, cities are growing at a furious pace, devouring sand in unprecedented quantities. The unmber of Vietnamese living in cities has double in the last twenty years, to some 32 million. Worldwide, the urban population is risin gby about 65 million people annually; that's the equivalent of adding eight New York Cites to the planet every single year. Nearly 50 billion tons of sand and gravel is extracted anually to create all the concrete office towers , apartment blocks, highways, and airports those people need. (Some Vietnamese sand is also sold to nearby Singapore, which uses gargantuan amounts to build artificial land)

Why,you might ask, don't we simply mine sand from the Sahara and other deserts? The answer is desert sand doesn't work in concrete the wind eroded grains are too smooth and rounded. As a result, from China to Jamaica, from Liberia to India,sand miners are plundering riverbeds, floodplains,and beaches for the preciou grains.

# Once Written Off for Dead, the Aral Sea Is Now Full of Life

Omirserik Ibragimov fixed his gaze on the hole he had carved out from the Aral Sea. The 25-year-old's hands moved steadily , pulling out a fishing net that he and father had left under the solid, snow-covered surface just three days earlier.

​	After a minute marked by tense silence, two breams emerged from the hole. Then three pike-perches , their silver scales shimmering as they struggled against the net's green meshing.

​	Here comes the gold, Omirserik said with a smile as he continued tugging the net. The pike-perch,with its tender flesh and few bones, is considered to be the most valuable catch, selling for roughly 650 tenge(a little over 2) for a kilogram; local fishermen refer to them as gold fish.

His father ,Kidirbai,worked with his bare hands to free the fish, his knuckles flush from the freezing water. After gathering all their nets, their total catch of the day was about 77 pounds of pike-perch and 44 pounds of bream a sizable haul for a few hours of work.

Just 15 years earlier, this would not have been possible. Once the world's fourth-largest freshwater lake,with an area of some 26000 square miles, the Aral Sea became the victim of the Soviet Union's agricultural policies in the 1950s.Water from its two river sources the Amu Darya and Syr Darya was intentionally diverted for cotton cultivation.

As decreasing water flow into the sea caused a rise in salinity, the abundant freshwater fish species began to die out. By the 1980s, the fishing industry in the Aralsk district once a robust source of employment for the region was wiped out , forcing a mass migration of people. The remaining population was hit by extreme weather, brought on by the dired-out Aral seabed, and deteriorating health.

The people destroyed the sea and then nature took revenge on the people, said Madi Zhasekenow, the director of the Aralsk Regional Museum and Fishermen Museum.

## MASSIVE DISASTER

This repid collapse over less than three decades which environmental scientists say is one of the planet's worst ecological disasters is marked today by the sea's reduced size. Its total area of water, straddling Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan , is now a tenth of its original size. What's left has broken into two distinct bodies: the North and South Aral Seas. In Uzbekistan, the entire eastern basin of the South Aral Sea is completely desiccated, leaving merely a single strip of water in the west.(Learn about other vanishing lakes around the world)

But Kazakhstan's North Aral Sea has seen a happier outcome,thanks to a nearly 86 million project financed in large part by the World Bank. Along with repairs to existing dikes around the basin to prevent spillage, an eight-mile dam was constructed just south of the Syr Darya River. Completed in the summer of 2005,this dam, named Kokaral, surpassed all expectations.It led to an 11 foot increase in water levels after just seven months a goal that scientists initially expected would take three years.

This turnarouond in the North Aral Sea's fate has meant that the fish stocks have returned to its waters, injecting new life into the local communities. Just as goverment policies had doomed the Aral Sea, careful planning and research helped revive at least part of it.\

Kristopher White, a researcher and professor of Almaty's KIMEP University who has studied the  economic impacts of the Aral Sea's desiccation,explained that while the sea will never return to its former size, the 18 percent increase in mass of the North Aral Sea is a testament to how political will and scientific research can benefit the environment.

Anthropogenic ecological damage can be reversed by human interventions, said White.

## OPTIMISM AND HOPE

At its peak in 1957, the Aral Sea produced more than 48 tons of fish, representing roughly 13 percent of the Soviet Union's fish stocks. By the 1980s, due to the rising salinity of the sea, the 20 native species of fish were decimated; coommercial harvests plummeted to zero 1987.The water from the sea receded, and today, the shore is about 12 miles(20 kilomietres )from Aralsk.

​	The major source of employment was gone, and with it optimism and hope for the future, said White. And that really prevailed throughout the region until the completion of this dam.

During those decades, flounder was the only fish that could survive the high-salinity North Aral Sea. But after the Kokaral Dam was finished, the average salinity dropped from 30 grams to 8 grams per  liter, prompting the return of almost two dozen freshwater species through the Syr Darya river.

​	According to the Aralsk Fish Inspection Unit, fish catch in the North Aral Sea has grown six-fold since 2006, when the bulk of the 1360 tons caught was flounder. By 2016 tons of fish was caught, with bream being the most common, followed by roach and the sought-after pike-pech. For 2018, the fishing limit is set at 8200 tons,said head inspector Esenbai Ensepov.

# 10 Strange Things You(Probably)Didn't Know About Earth

The planet we all call hom is even more bizarre than you might imagine.

​	There's no doubt that planet Earth is awe-inspiring. That's even more true for the handful of humans who've seen it from space with their own eyes.

​	We tend to think of ourselves as a weird,tiny little human being on a very large, powerful planet, and there clearly irrelevant to anything that might affect the planet at a planetary scale, says former NASA astronaut Kathryn Sullivan, who in 1984 bacame the first US woman to walk in space.In some ways that's true. But if you step back and look at the planet in total, you see how richly interconnected and interwined all the actual systems are.

​	Even with all its magnificence and majesty, Earth is also just kind of strange.Aside from the fact that it's the only planet known(so far) to support lefe, it has a bunch of inherent quirks, from geophysical weirdness to the landscapes adorning its surface to the organisms it supports. And the  more we learn about Earth's peculiarities, the more we grow to appreciate and treasure its many wonders-starting with the air we breathe.

​	You look back at the Earth and that huge majestic ocean, the atmosphere is a lot more like the fuzz on a tennis ball than some big massive thing, Sullivan says. It's like the wall of a soap bubble, this littlt membrane that envelops this grain of rock and is the reason that critters like us can live.

​	Here are some of the oddest things about this gas-shrouded ball of water and rock we call home.

## The Planet's Poles Flip

​	We all know that North is, well,north—somewhere above Alaska-and south is down near the middle of Antarctica. That will always be true for the planet's geographic poles, but it's only intermittently true for the planet's magnetic poles. Over the past 20 million years, the magnetic poles have flip-flopped every several hundred years or so, which means that if you had a compass in hand about 800000 years ago, it  would tell you that north was in Antarctica.

​	Though scientists are pretty sure Earth's churning, molten iron core powers these polar acrobatics, it's not entirely clear what triggers the actual reversals.The process is gradual and occure over millenia, For now, Earth's north magnetic pole is creeping northward by about 40 miles a year.And given that the last major pole reversal happened 78000 years ago, we are overdue for a flip.

	## It Has a Supersized Moon

Sunday evening marked the most recent rising of the supermoon, but regardless of how large Earth's moon appears in the sky on any given night, it's always among the solar system's most overgrown satellites.Relative to Earth, it's positively enormous, coming in at a quarter as wide as our home planet.

​	The only celestial twosome that bests Earth-moon team in this regard is Pluto and its biggest moon Charon,which really from more of a binary system- a pair of objects twirling around each other—rather than a typical planet moon pair. And thank goodness the moon is so big and so close. If it were smaller or farther away, we would never see total solar eclipses.

## The Biggest Mammal Migration Is Airborne

Yep,you may have thought the 1.3 million wildbeest that hoof their way between Kenya and Tanzania were tops, but you'd be wrong.

​	Millions and millions of bats-giant  fruit bast, to be exact-fly between teh Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia's Kasanka National Park each year.With more than 10 million of these cat-size, mango-munching, echolocating chiropterans involved, it's the largest known mammal migration on Earth.

# This Tiny Beetle Is Devastating Forests In the Worst Outbreak Ever

​	Despite being smaller than a grain of rice, mountain pine beetles are causing big problems for pine forests across North America.Bark beetle colonies feed and reproduce on the inner bark of ponderosa and limber pines, wreaking deadly havoc on the tree's ability to circulate nutrients and absorb water. Due to changes in climate and other factors, the recent outbreak of these destructive insects has reached proportions never before seen in recorded history.Alarming estimates from the US Forest Service state that 100 beetle-infested trees fall daily across the United States.

​	To combat this epidemic, Professor Diana Six has made it her mission to crack the genetic code of the pine tree. She hopes that studying the relationship between the mountain pine beetle and the trees they kill will provide us with valuable insight into the future of our forests.In this short film made at the International Wildlife Film Festival Filmmaker Labs, Professor Six walks among the trees and shares her thoughts on why humans can do more to conuteract the effects of climate change.

# Why the Brain-Body Connection Is More important Than We Think

​	Our brains aren't flying solo; our emotions also come into play when we're interacting with the world, new research finds.

​	The idea that our brains are like giant supercomputers, orchestrating and determining everything we do, has gained ground in recent years. So too have ideas that a short time ago would have been regarded as science fiction, like downloading the Internet directly to our brains, or creating a new kind of human, one with enhanced cognitive powers.

​	In his new book, The Biological Mind, Alan Jasanoff,professor of biological engineering at MIT, explains why this cerebral mystique creates a false dichotomy between the brain and the body and ignores bodily influences on our psychology,from chemicals in the blood to bacteria in the gut.

​	Speaking from his office at MIT, he explained why Red Sox legend Ted Williams has his body frozen;why changes in temperature influence how much Dutch police shoot their guns; and why the idea of downloading the Internet directly into our brains is not a good one.

# One of the underlying concepts in your book is what you call the cerebral mystique.Can you explain what it means and why this view of the brain is distorting our real natures?

​	This book is largely about two  opposite ideas:the biological mind centered on the brain, in which influences from the rest of  the body and outside the body shape what we think and do, and the cerebral mystique, a complex of  sterotyper and ideals about the brain, which tend to treat it as an isolated and all-powerful entity,almost like a modern version of th soul.

​	The problem with having a dualistic view of the brain and its relationship to the physical body, and the physical world, is that it makes us see ourselves as unnaturaly self-contained, both as minds and as autonomous agents. In other words, we view ourselves as things that operate from within, so we're less sensitive to things that influence us on the outside. The idea that the brain is a machine, an abstract entity like a giant supercomputer, has been around for a  while, basically since computers. Other people have used a quantum analogy for the brain. But the idea of the brain as a computer is the most common in this day and age.

# New research suggsts that our emotions, as much as our brains, are key in mediating how we perceive and interact with the world. Tell us about Lauri Nummenmaa's study.

Yes! People have at various times in history been sensitized to the ways the body and brain coordinate emotions. A fascinating study published a few years ago asked participants to map, on pictures of their own body, where they feel sensations as they experience different emotions. The investigators looked at something like 15 variegated emotions and found different bodily maps for each of those things. The first group of participants was Finnish.To test for cultural biases, they looked at a second group, I think Japanese, and found similar responese.

​	Probably the most famous person who has advocated the view  that emotions are key to learning or behavior is Daniel Kahneman. His studies showed that there's this apparently repid, irrational, shoot-from -the-hip way to make decisions, which is important in the behaviroal side of economics. In our field in neuroscience, Antonio Damasio has argued for many  years that there's a loop between the body and the brain. This involves bodily signatures that get tied to different contexts in our enviroment, and steer us towards different behavioral outcomes. This is one way in which the body is cognitively involved in our actions, in a way many people wouldn't believe when confronted with the more mystical view of the  brain as a self-contained machine.

# A new area of neuroscience known as connectomics seeks to give a kind of unifying theory of the brain.Explain what it means, and what the Human Connectome Project is doing

​	Connectiomics means two differnet things in our community.The one I personally interact with is more about mapping the individual's structures, chiefly cells in the brain. The Human Connectome Project is a bit different because it looks, at roughly three orders of magnitude lower resolution, at the superhighways that connect different regions of the brain and tries to relate those to aspects of brain activity and genetics. What both these views have in common is that they're trying to describe key aspects of brain funciton in terms of its intrinsic structure.

# Find Bliss in This Stunning Floral Kingdom

> Whether exporing these unique flowers in the wild, or touring the Kirstenbosch botanical gardens, teh rare flora in this kingdom is sure to impress.

​	Many travelers visit South Africa to see the Big Five animals, soak in the views from Table Mountain, or relax on a beach where two oceans meet-essential experiences in this multicultureal nation. There is so much to offer in South Africa, that one of its most unique qualities can sometimes go overlooked. The world is divided into six Floral Kingdoms, also called Floristic Regions. South Africa is home to the smallest-by far- and most unique Floral Kingdom, as designated by plant geographers. Thirty percent of the plant genera in South Africa's Cape Floristice Regions are found nowhere else in the world.

​	Here are five ways to experience the unique flora of the fynbos,or fine bush, in this UNESCO World Heritage site all within a day's drive from Cape Town.

​	On the edge of bustling Cape Town, find yourself in a colorful, kaleidoscopic escape. The 1300-acre garden is expansive and beautifully organized. Get lost in the hills of color, follow a detailed map, or join a free walking tour(after paying the five dollar entry fee). The garden is also home to frequent music and movie events on summer evenings. And not to be missed o a clear day is the Boomslang Tree Canopy Walkway, a steel and timber bredge that winds(like a boomslang ,or tree snake)through the canopy providing aerial views of the gardens and Table Mountain.

​	From most areas in Cape Town it is hard to miss the New7 Wonder of Nature that is Table Mountain. A cable car can take you up and down the mountain should you choose to skip a hike, just be sure to check the site frequently for weather and wait time updates. Table Mountain National Park boasts more plant species than all of New Zealand, so hiking , expecially with a guide or  naturalist, will give you the opportunity to truly experience the unparalleled diversity.  Consult with a guide company like Hike Table Mountain to find which of the hundreds of possible routes is best for you.

# The Giant Squid Nebula and More Animals of the Cosmos

> As galixies collide and new stars are born, spectacular shapes form in the universe-and many of them resumble Earthly creatures.

​	If you can't get enough of the animals here on Earth, just look forward the heavens.There you will find eagles,elephants,whals,and more-as long as you have a powerful telescope and an even more powerful imagination.

​	Astronomers have long named galaxies, nebulae, and other astronomical phenomena for the animals they resemble when observed from Earth.Now these animal look-alikes, comprised of starts and stardust,number in the dozons.Nebulae alone,for example,represent at least 20 example at 20 animals,from giant squid to running chickens.

​	These are the objects that really capture people's imaginations,says Karen Masters,associate professor of astronomy at Haverford Collage.It's human nature to see familiar things in the unfamiliar,(See an epic picture that shows thousands of galaxies in one frame)

​	And to early observers,these phenomena were indeed unfamiliar.Nebulae are cosmic clouds of gas and dust, linked to the birth or death of starts,whereas galaxies are ensembles of millions or billions of starts bound together by gravity.

​	Animal names, like Mice Galaxies,have been used for years-and in some cases, centuries.But they're not actually offcial, says Thierry Montmerle, former General Secretry of the International Astronomical Union,which oversees the naming of astronomical objects.

​	It's very informal, he says.The name is adopted by popular demand,and the LAU is perfectly happy with that.

# More Birds Expected for Majority of National Parks-Here's Why

> Climate change may have big impacts on avian species, and all the result may not be positive.

​	Dozons of different birds-Northern pintails,wild turkeys, Franklin's gull, Sterller's jays,and cedar waxwings,just to name a few- make homes for themselves in Yellowstone National Park during at least of the year.Millions of birdwatchers make their way here and to national parks all over the country each year to see them.

​	Collectively,birdwatchers spend 107 billion dollars annually in the US. But if climate change continues uninterrupted ,duck enthusiasts may have to  travel elsewhere if they wish to catch a glimpse of a Northern pintail.By 2050,this species could no longer find suitable habitat in Yellowstone.On the other hand, avian enthusiasts could begin to see the Western scrub jay showing up there, at least in the winter.

​	Because they can move around so easily  on their wings, birds are often considered indicator species.When the climate begins to change, birds are often the first to display a response that we notice. Recent assessments of the impacts of climate change on birds in  the US and Canada suggest that one in five species are highly vulnerable to climate change; that is , they are so particular about the temperatures they can tolerate that they may disappear entirely from some parts of their range. But if they're lucky, they can expand elsewhere into newly suitable habitat.

​	A team of research from the National Audubon Society and the US National Park Service reported Wednesday in the journal PLOS ONE that 60 percent of US national parks could become more hospitable for birds overall by the middle of the century-if climate change continues apace.In other words, the number of potential new colonizations would the number of potential local extirpations for roughly three out of every five national parks.That's based on an assessment of 513 species across 274 parks.

​	You often hear of climate change being all doom and gloom,but one of the finding is that in winter especially, parks are going to become more important sanctuaries for birds, says Audubon Society avian biologist Joanna Wu, who led the study.

Some birds may even stop migrating if winters and mild enough that they can tolerate local conditions, says Wu.

## THE POWER OF PARKS

​	The new data underscore just how critical it is to protect the national park system-often referred to as America 's Best Idea—to ensure a bright future for as many North American birds as possible, the reearchers say.

​	But they also suggest that the avian communities of the future could look dramaticallly different from the ones we know today. And it is at best unclear what ecological consequences would emerge if Wu's predictions come true.

​	We're saying that climate will become suitable ,but the species dispersal capacity, ability to find resources and food and places to raise their chicks,those are all big question marks, she say.

​	Indeed,says McGill University avian biologist Barbara Frei, who was not involved in the study, if the birds can adapt to climate change by moving north, but the trees they depend on can't, where will they nest?

# You Have to Grab This Moment

> A business icon stresses the importance of finding common ground during times of increased divesiveness in America.

​	Ann Fudge was a high school junior in segregated WashingtonDC when Martin Luther King JR was assassinated on April 4,1968.In the days that followed, while standing outside a Rhode Island Avenue convenience store waiting for her grandfather, an armed guardsman pointed a gun toward Fudge's face and asked her if she knew a curfew had been declared. The shop owner and her grandfather rushed outside to vouch for her, but the experience left an indelible mark. One of only four black girls in a class of one  hundred at Immaculata Preparatory School, Fudge made a commitment to excel in all that she set out to accomplish.She went on to attend Simmons College and Harvard Business School, becoming one of the top women business leaders in America.

​	Fudge spent several years as chairman and chief executive officer of Young & Rubicam, a globle advertising agency, and has led several business, including a five-billion-dollar division of Kraft Foods.Now, 50 years later, Fudge says that painful that her five grandchildren will not be confronted with the same racial intolerance.

​	Fudge sat down for a conversation with National Geographic Editor in Chief Susan Goldberg to discuss the legacy of Martin Luther King JR,the current racial climate in America, and the importance of communicating across differences.

​	Susan Goldberg:

​		Talk about your experience following the assassination of DR. King.

​	Ann Fudge:

​		You experience the heatbreak of this person that you felt was making a difference. My parents had gone to the March on Washington.I didn't go , but I still keep picture that were taken.They're faded now.Right away the climate was ugly.I've seen ugly stuff before . You talk to other black people they're seen ugly things before.

​	Observing the change in the city afterward was stark. It gave me a sense of incredible empowerment.I grew up in a time when there weren't even black bus drivers.We had trolleys then,or streetcars as we called them.A year or so later you saw black people in jobs you never thought you'd see, even in stores like Garfinckel's where they didn't have many salespeople. There were little things like that.I remember my parents saying,You have to grab this moment.It's a moment in time.And we don't know when the door will close again.I remember that.It's one of those things I think,I know, was a driver for me personally to make a difference and to do something different.When you think about momnets in time and history, you don't understand the history until decades later.At this juncture in my life, I think about it a lot. I think about legacy.I think about what I want for my five grandchildren. I don't ever want them to ever have to experience anything like that. And so when I see what's happening today, it pains me beyond measure.I say ,Oh my god, are we doing to go through this again?

​	Susan Goldberg:

​		Does it feel like that is what's happening?What would make it better?

​	Ann Fudge: People of goodwill have to move forward in a positive way.We cannot get sucked into criticizing every day what somebody's doing that we don't like.Things are happening, but what are we doing that's positive? I work with girls at Mother Caroline Academy.I don't want them to have bad experiences. Many of them are from immigrant familes.You have to keep them positive.I'm just going go focus on making a difference and impacting what I can, getting my friends engaged.Thank God I live in a space and grew up at a time where my network of friends is incredibly broad and diverse,both in the US and internationally. I'm grateful that I had that and not the fear, which many of my friends in Washington had.When you don't have the experience and exposure to people who are good, no matter what color you are,it clouds how you think about them and fuels your skepticism.

​	Susan Goldberg:

​		Why do you think you emerged from a pretty scary moment when somebody takes out a  gun and is pointing it at you with more strength,when other people might just retreat? What pushed you?

​	Ann Fudge:Growing up watching things on television during that period in the 60s and knowing that only by coming together would things change.

​	Washington was very segregated when I grew up. So you don't know what you don't know.And then you make friends.And you realize we truly are human being if we can step beyond and talk honestly about things.Until we get to a point where it's not just black folks talking about it among themselves or white folks talking to each other.The challenge is that it's a global issue in every country.We find ways to separate people or to make one group better than the other.

​	I saw things on television in the 50s and 60s that are seared in my head, whether it was the water hoses or the dogs . I feel like I'm back there again.I feel like I'm back to where we were before.And that's not a good feeling.For some, it's probably been nascent.Here's the that concerns me most.It's almost like, to make America great again, we have to do this with these people.It's creating a whole other dynamic.I'm so open . But I worry.

# Arctic Sea Ice Is Second-Lowest on Record

​	But the amount of ice found throughout most of the Arctic was even lower than in recent years, except for the region around Janpan.

​	Severely warm temperatures drove Arctic sea ice to a high of 5.6 million square miles this winter- one of its lowest on record, according to an annual evaluation released Friday by NASA.

​	Yet even though there was slightly more ice overall across the northern latitudes this winter than during last year's record-breaking low, scientists saw several troubling trends during the winter of 2017-2018.

​	During February, temperatures skyrocketed to a wild winter high more than 45 degress above normal in some areas, sending the North Pole-in the dead of winter, when the region is shrouded in darkness - above freezing for several days. Massive sections of Greenland, normally blanketed by thick,old ice,experienced open water for the first time on record. Much of the Bering Sea off Alaska, and for a while, the whole of the Bering Strait, was also ice-free, which is pretty remarkable, says NASA sea ice expert Alek Petty.

​	And despite not breaking last year's record, this winter continued a recent trend of being worse than scientists expected.

​	These last few winters have all been above our projections for air temperature predictions and sea-ice declines, Petty says.

## THE ARCTIC'S VALUERABILITY

​	While climate change is warming the globe,it's hitting the poles even harder.

​	And as rising temperatures drive the loss of sea ice, the loss of ice itself ends up making the situation even worse.

​	It's a two-way street,Claire Parkinson, senior climate scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center said in the agency's announcenment.The warming means less ice is going go from and more ice is going to melt. Also, because there's less ice, less of the sun's solar radiation is reflected off, and this contributes to the warming.

​	In fact, through most of the winter, the Arctic was on track to have its worst period ever. The only reason this winter ultimately did't break yet another record for low sea ice was that as cooler air in recent weeks allowed ice to reform the increase near Japan in the sea of Okhotsk was significant enough to make up for losses elsewhere.

## STORMY WEATHER

​	What happened this winter was that storms from both the Atlantic and the Pacific sent warm water and winds into the north.

​	Part of the problem, of course,is that those ocean bodies are warmer than they once were. In addition, over time, the Arctic has lost evermore of the thicker,older ice that stabilizes the entire region. That means that the wamth from storm event that pummel the Arctic travels father and does more damage, causing the ice to melt even more.

​	For example, the big hole in the ice that opened up over Greenland closed rather quickly after the heat subsided. But NASA officials say the new ice is thinner and less stable, and more susceptible to whatever warm spell comes next.

## SEE THE WILDLIFE OF ANWR

​	We recently looked back and were able to show that extreme warm periods have happened before in the Arctic, even 100 years ago, Petty says. But what we're seeing is that there's an increase in the frequency of these incidents, they are lasting longer, and the impact on sea ice is even greater. The storms are simply eating away at the sea ice more than they used to .

​	The key,of course, is that all these ice declins are having immeasurable impact on the globe- increasing heat and moisture in the atmosphere, changing mixing and circulation of the Arctic ocean, affecting what and where things live, even altering the globe climate system. And these shifts will only get worse until and unless humans dramatically scale back carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of coal , oil,and gas.

​	The changes are just going to get more severe, Petty says.

# Photos from March for Lives Events Around the Globe

> Take a look at powerful moments from the movement protesting gun violence,led by young adults,that has spread throught the world.

​	Now we fight for our lives.

​	That is the call to action urged by the March For Our Lives website following a rally that drew hundreds of thousands to Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, DC this Saturday to protest gun violence.Sister marches took place not only across the country, but around the world—adding up to 846 events globally, with one even held in Antarctica.

​	No matter the location, the unifying message of these protests was clear: Enough is enough.Many of those who carried signs or spoke at the rally demanded tougher gun-control laws, including banning the sale of assault weapons and closing loopholes on background checks.

## A NEW Class of Leaders

​	It has taken only 38 days for the surviving students of the shooting at Marjory Stonemen Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, to ignite a nationwide movement toward gun reform.

​	Many of the school's students spoke at the main March For Our Lives event in Washington DC Senior Emma Gonzalez asked the crowed to fight for your lives before it's someone else's job.

​	Perhaps the most moving part of Gonzalez's speech ,though, was silence . She allotted herself six minutes and 20 seconds for her speech — the amount of time, she said, that it had  taken Nilolas Cruz to kill 17 in Parkland and injure many more.

​	A surprise appearance was also made by Yolanda Renee King, the 9–year-old granddaughter of the revolutionary Martin Luther King JR and Coretta Scott King—and she has a dream of her own.I have a dream that enough is enough, she said. That this should be a gun-free world.Period.

​	The young, determined voives didn't stop at the stage.Children and teens of all ages showed up with signs in tow.One fourth-grade girl who came with fellow students from Francis Scott Key Elementary School in Arlignton ,Virginia, held a sign that read: We may be small but we have a voice.

​	Volunter could also be seen throughout the througs of crowds calling for people to register to vote.Stickers adorning protestors' jackets and signs counted down the day until US midterm elections , which will take place in eight months on November 6.The elections are seen as a chance to bring in more members of Congress as well as state and local officials who support gun-control measures.

## What Happens Now?

​	In every midterm election since the  Civil War, the president's party has lost an average of 32 seats in the House and two in the Senate.This year, Democrats need only 24 seats to take majority in the House, and two to take the Senate.

​	Conversation has also recently been sparked by the new spending bill, which was signed by President Trump on Friday.Agency instructions that accompany the bill note that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will now have the authority to conduct research on the causes of gun violence.

​	The problem? In 1996 Congress passed the Dickey Amendment, saying that none of the funds give to the CDC for injury prevention could be used to advocate for or promote gun control.The Arkansas Republican for which the federal amendment is named for, Jay Dickey,told  NPR that he actually regretted the decision, saying It wasn't necessary that all research stop.

# Pictures: World's Iconic Buildings Go Dark for Earth Hour

> Iconic buildings go dark to raise awareness around energy consumption and climate change.

​	The bright green lights that typically illuminate the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur—the tallest twin buildings in the world—were turned off for a recent Earth Hour—an annual event aimed at raising awareness about energy consumption.

​	Dozens of other iconic landmarks around the world, including the Parthenon in Greece, the Golden Gate Bridge in California, and Australia's Sydney Harbor Bridge,have participated in the annual event, which is sponsored by the World Wildlife Fund.

​	The first Earth Hour took has grown and spread around the world. Thousands of cities now switch off many lights for the hour in a symbol of environmental awareness.More than 170 countriyes take part, along with dozens of UNECO World Heritage Sites.

​	Connecting the event to a wider message, then-UN Secretary General Ban KiMoon said in 2015:Earth Hour is a way for the citizens of the world to send a clear message that they want action on climate change.

​	Earth Hour takes place from 8.30 to 9.30 pm, in each time zone around the planet.

​	Here are some pictures of famous monuments observing the darkness of Earth Hour in recent years.

## Acropolis

​	Dating to 447BC the Parthenon in Athens is one of the most famous surviving buildings of ancient Greece.The city of Athens has turned off its buildings' lights for Earth Hour and asked locals to follow suit.

## Sydney

​	Sydney Harbor Bridge is the largest steel arch bridge in the world,connecting its city's north and south harbors.Thousands of houses and businessess in Sydney go dark on Earth Hour.

## Eiffel Tower

​	Built as an archway for an international world fair in 1889, the Eiffel Tower got some help from Spiderman in turning its lights off on Earth Hour 2014

## The Big Apple

​	Times Square is the busiest commecial intersection in New York City and the world's most visited tourist attraction.For the first time ever,in 2014 the city called in a specialist to turn off its New Year's Eve ball, which typically remains on throughout the year.

## Minsk, Belarus

​	In the Belarusian capital of Minsk, the monument to humanist Francysk Skaryna is usually lit by the bright purple lights from the National Library.Big  department stores and universities also turned off their lights in Minsk for the event.

## Brandenburg Gate

​	The Brandenburg Gate was built in 1791 as an entryway to Berlin.It survived World War II but with extensive damage. The Earth Hour motto in Germany in 2014:You don't need to be a superhero to take action on climate change.

## The Alhambra

​	The Alhambra, a fortress-turned-palace that dates to 1258,watches over the city of Granada in southern Spain.

# Our Favorite Love Letters to Earth

​	There's a planet with poles that flip, a supersized moon, and landscapes that harbor acidic pools, boiling rivers and living clouds.

​	We call it Earth.

​	On National Geographic's new global series event One Strange Rock, filmamker Darren Aronofsky and host Will Smith take views on a Journey to explore our planet in all its fregility and ferocity.In advance of the premiere episode,we asked the world to send us love letters to the beautifully strange planet we all share.

​	We wanted to know how you feel about Earth.What do you love? What inspires you? Are there places you've been to ,things you have seen,and people you've know that have shaped how you feel about this planet?

​	The responses on Twitter,Facebook,and Instagram speak to our collective imperative to explore the planet, the good and the bad, because the more you know, the more likely you are to care—and to do something to help pretect the only home we've ever known.Here are some of our favorite responses so far.

​	Geographic,we have the privilege of covering the stories of our planet.We capture the beauty of landscapes and the animals who live in them. We explore the lives of people around the world.We take our readers and viewers to remote corners they otherwise would never see.Our journey also show us scars we have left on the planet—the clear-cut forests,pollution,unsustainable cityes.Our job is to explore all of it—the good and the bad—because the more you know, the more you care, the more likely you are to do something to help.This is our Love Letter to Earth.

​	Earth is where we call home.But how often do we imagine the BILLONS of things that had togo RIGHT in order for this place to not go WROGN.every ecosystem that had to interact perfectly to bring us to a place where we can live, breath,and THRIVE on a rock spinning at 1000mph.Earth grounds us Earth still has so much to offer  Thanx for inviting me to be a part of his amazing project

​	So happy! I was given the chance to go back to my classical roots and write this piece of music for 

# New Human Organ Was Hiding in Plain Sight

> The interstitium,scientists found,is under our skin and between our organs.Understanding it may eventually help treat disease.

​	Lurking just under your skin might be a new organ only now identified for the firtst time, say a team of scientists.

​	In a new study pulished in  the journal Scientific Reports,researchs from New York University's School of Medicine say they have found a new organ they're calling the interstitium.

​	It's nearly everywhere—just below the skin's surface, surrounding arteries and veins, casing the fibrous tissue between muscle,and lining our digestive tracts,lungs and urinary systems.

​	It looks like a mesh.The interstitium is a layer of fluid-filled compartments strung together in a web of collagen and a flexible protein elastin .Previously,scientists thought the layer was simply dense connective tissue.

​	The organ has seemingly been hidden in plain sight, and scientists say they missed it because of the way tissus is studied.Before being placed under a microscope,samples are thinly sliced and treated with chemicals that allow researchers to identify key components more easily. While the process is helpful for more easily spotting details,it drains fluid from the sample.

​	Devoid of their fluid , the compartments collapse,like a building with the floors suddenly knocked out, leaving the whole structure to flatten like a pancake.

​	To find these pockets of intrstitial fluid,medical reseachers  looked at living tissue instead of sampling dead tissue samples.They did this by using a probing technique called confocal laser endomicroscopy. The method entails using a tiny camera probe that takes a microscopic look around a human body.Tissue is lit by the endoscope's lasers and the fluorescent patterns it then refelcts are analyzed by sensors.

## ACCIDENTAL DISCOVERY

​	Scientists first noticed the compartments when looking at a bile duct. They saw what they thought might be tears in dense tissue.The images were taken to Neil Theise, a professor at NYU's School of Medicin and author on the paper.

​	You're talking about the remaining extracellular fluid that's unaccounted for, Theise says.About 70 percent of the human body is made of  water, and about  two thirds of that is  found in cells.The remaining third, says Theise, is only partically known.

​	In addition to accounting for bodily fluid, the compartments may help explain essential functions.

​	It's like a shock absober, says Theise.Not a hard, stiff material.

​	Among Theise's theories for the purpose of the interstitium is that it's a source of lymph, a fluid that moves through the body's lymphatic system and supports immunity.He says that knowing how diseases spread through this part of the body could help researchers better understand how cancer spreads.

​	Can we detect earlier by sampling fluid from the space? Can we figure out mechanisms to stop spread ? He asks.

## PROMISE AND SKEPTICISM

​	Jennifer Munson is a biomedical engineer at Virginia Tech who has looked at fluid in the body.She was not involved with the study but says its finding are promising.

​	I think what the paper shows is the benefit of having new ways to image and look at tissues.dehydrate the tissues, and you lose so much structural information, Munson notes.

​	She say she's fairly convinced these structures exist but wants to see more research before speculating on what they do, and whether its accurate to call them a new organ.

​	I'm really excited about the find but as with all scientists,I approach everything with a little skepticism, she adds.

​	Theise say he's aware of some of the skepticism surrounding his findings, but it's territory he's not shy about wading into.In 2005, he wrote an essay in Nature challening the importance of call theory a concept that holds cells as the basic structure of all organisms, and in 2001, he published a  paper finding that adult stem cells could be made to act similiarly to embryonic cells.

​	There's always going to be stuff we haven't seen before that we don't know, he adds. I'm awestruck that nature is more complicated than we allow ourselves to think .

# Bears Are Caring for Their Cubs Longer in Response to Hunting

> Result from a new study could have implications for brown bear evolution.

​	Over the years, several researchers noticed a change in  the way that Scan din avian brown bears care for their young. Sweden has one of  the fastest bear reproduction rates in  the world, and it seems that females were spending more time with their cubs.

​	We needed to provide evidence, and  then that triggered new questions, says Joanie Van de Walle, a PhD student in the Department of Biology at the Universite de Sherbrooke in Quebec, Canada.

​	Van de Walle is part of an international team of researchers who combed through decades of data on brown bear populations in Sweden to investigate this trend. By following the lives of hundreds of bears, the researchers determined that more mothers are raising their cubs for one year longer than they have in the past.

​	This behavioral shift can be directly attributed to humans, according to a study published March 27 in Nature Communications.With a population of around 3000 bears that could be increasing by as much as five percent each year, sustainable hunting tactics can keep bear numbers at bay.This behavioral shift of mother bears caring for their young for a longer time could be directly related to hunting regulations.

​	In the same way that humans shape wildlife by killing animals, we can also shape wildlife by not killing them.Long-term, this could have implications for brown bear evolution.

​	Evolutionarily, it doesn't usually make sense for wildlife to have fewer offspring and care for them over a long period of time. When facing high hunting pressure,it's logical that brown bears would have as many cubs as possible, but the team's findings contradict this.

​	The researchers looked at 22 years' worth of data,following more than 500 bears, many of them from birth to death.Before 2005, they found that only about seven percent of Scandinavian brown bear mothers kept their cubs for a year and a half. Between 2005 and 2015, the study found that more than 36 percent of females are keeping their cubs for an extra year.Although the amount of time spent with their young is changing, the strategies bear mothers are using to raise their cubs are not.

​	Hunting pressure in Sweden is high, and the researchers were surprised by these findings. But when related to a relatively recent law that makes it illegal to hunt mother bears in Sweden, the data make more sense. Staying in family groups would provide a win-win situation for females to lead safer lives protescted from hunters while allowing them more time to care for their young.

​	A single female in Sweden is four times more likely to be shot as one with a cub, Jon Sweden, a professor in the Department of Ecology and Natural Resource Management at the University of Life Sciences,says in a press release.

​	Caring for the cubs for a longer time has the added bonus of giving them a better chance of survival long-term.The researchers found that femals cubs that received extended parenting survived their second year of life.But 22 percent of cubs that were cut loose after a year and a half didn't make it to three years.In addition to being hunted by humans, all cubs that mothers let go of early were more likely to be killed by other bears  over brawls for teritory or resources.

​	This new technique of reproducing slower but taking care of cubs for longer outpaces reproductive opportunities, Van de Walle says.

# Striking Photos of The Men Who Work in an Active Volcano

> Mount Ijen's gorgeous vistas have captivated travelers for centures,but in recent years, its sulfur mine has become a controversial tourist attraction.

> Thirty-six-year-old Hadis has been a full-time miner for 10 years.He recently started as a cook in a nearby tourist restaurant,but periodically returns to the mine for extra income.

​	A trick veil of smoke erases the sky over Mount Ijen, the scent of burent matches saturates the air.

​	The noxious material that seeps from the bowels of East Java's active volcano is incongruous with human life-it stings the eyes, burns the lungs, and corrodes the skin. But since 1968, the sulfur miners of Mount Ijen have venturend into this unpredicatable labyrinth of gas clouds and superheated fumardoles to extract devil's gold and carry it back down the mountain—a portrait of bone—crushing physical labor.

​	Mount Ijen hosts one of the last remaining active sulfur mine in the world, and while its otherworldly vistas have captivated scientists and travelers for more than two centuries, in recent decades, the miners themselves have become a controversial tourist attraction.

## EVVIL'S GOld

​	Every day, miners make the arduous trek up Ijen's 9000-foot slopes under the cover darkness before descending another 3000 feet into the crater, where a network of man-made cermic piples funels the gases responsible for precipitating elemental sulfur.

​	Enveloped in toxic fumes and heat, they chip away at the hardend blocks and carry 150 to 200-pound loads back up the crater twice a day, earning an average of five dollars per trip.

​	Around 2.am when the first miners begin their ascent, hundreds of tourists are already streaming across the flanks of Ijen to witness its iconic blue flames, which can only be seen at night .Its half-mile turquoise creater lake takes on an eerie glow in the darkness.Deceptively beautiful, it has a PH lower than that of battery acid- the largest acid lake on Earth, caustic enough to dissolve metal.

## TOURISM OR VOYEURISM

​	Considered a form of cultural heritage tourism, mine tours can be found around the world  from Africa to Australia.Unlike Mount Ijen, few are still active, and many have been museunified.

​	Some researchers propose tourists are attracted to these sites because they elicit what philosophers have termed the sublime a feeling of pleasure in seeing a dangerous but awe-inspiring object, like a violent act of nature.Victor Hugo defined it as a combination of the grotesque and beautiful as opposed to the classical ideal of perfection.

​	During high season, the mountain can see more than a thousand tourists per day. They often ask the miners to pose for photographs in exchange for small tips, what critics argue is a form of poverty tourism—the commodification of human suffering.

​	Tourists seem to relish narrating their tales of survival in apparently dangerous situations, an attitude not unlike that found towards other potentially hazardous receations and extreme sports, explains University of North Alababa geography professor Michael Pretes in the Annals of Tourism Research.

​	On the other hand, tourism can also be a powerful tool for economic development and expose unfavorable working canditions regardless of motivations for visiting. The tourism industry in East Java at large employs an region,and the workers are well-respected members of their communities .Many pride themselves on their physical fitness and role in attracting visitors to the island.

​	Tourists are seen as the new ore to be mined,and like metals , have the potential to provide economic booms as well as busts, according to Pretes, who studied the active sliver mines in Potosi, Bolivia.He argues that mining tourism can have a multiplier effect by bringing income to local hotels , restaurants, stores, transportation, and nearby historical sites.

​	Despite these potential advantaages, the risks remain high. Many miners can't afford protective equipment like gloves and masks ,or choose to forgo them because it hinders their work.Short-term exposure to highly concentrated levels of sulfur dioxide can be deadly,and chronic exposure can lead to breathing diffculties, airway obstructions, and impaired lung function, according to the Centers for Disease Control.

​	To prevent the objectification of people living in improverished conditions, ethical travel experts reccommend that tourists refrain from taking photographs solicit permission from the subjects being photographed.

# Why Are American Samoans Not US Citizens?

> If you are born in Guam or Puerto Rico,you are automatically granted citizenship.If you are born in American Samoa, that isn't the case.

​	The residents of American Samoa have a long tradition of voyaging to new lands as part of their ancestors' history.But in modern times, going beyond their five islands and two coral atolls in the South Pacific Ocean has often proven legally challenging.

​	Despite American Samoa's status as a US territory, the people who are born there aren't technically US citizens.They're called US nationals, a status that means they pay American taxes but cannot vote, run for office, or serve on a jury. They also have special passports that declare them nationals, but not US citizens.

​	This unusual status has prompted a group of American Samoans living in Utah to file a lawsuit, arguing that they should be considered US citizens under the 14th Amendment which grants citizenship at birth to anyone born in the US . The group says they face travel restrictions when they leave American Samoa, sometimes having to pay fees or obtain permits that US citizens don't need in order to travel , the Associated Press reports.

​	What makes this US territory differnet from the other four-the US Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands,Guam, and Puerto Rico-when it comes to citizenship?

​	It boils down to American Samoa's unincorportated status.In the early 20th century, the US couts defined territories as incorportated and unincorporated in order to divvy up the land that the US. received from the end of the Spanis American War. The justices who made those distinctions saw the people living in the unincorporated territories as uncivilized races and said that granting citizenship to them could be dangerous, in the group of rulings that bacame known as the Insular Cases.

​	Eventually, the other four territories listed above gained birthright citizenship through statutes, meaning people who are born there are automatically US. citizens. But because Samoa is the only territory still classified as unincorated, people who born there are only considered US citizens if they have a parent who is a US citizen.Otherwise, they have to go through the same lengthy, expensive naturalization process as any other person who isn't a citizen with no guarantee that it will be successful.

​	The lawsuit is the second such attempt within the past decade. The first, filed in 2012 was ultimately unsuccessful, with the Supreme Court ruling in 2015 that the 14th Amendment does not apply to overseas territories. The court decided not to reconsider that ruling when it was brought up again in 2016.

​	Leneuoti Tuaua, a former marshal for the High Court of American Samoa who holds two titles, was one of  seven American Samoans who filed the first lawsuit.Tuaus said American Samoans are treated differently whenever they travel abroad, even to places like independent Samoa the island country next door.

​	I want my children to have same world of opportunities available to them that are avaiable to any other child in any other part of the United States, Tuaus said in an editorial for Samoa News published in July 2012.I for on believe that our traditional leaders were right when they believed that US citizenship followed the American flag to our islands.

# Oil Spill Kills More Than 2400 Animals

> An unclear amount of oil has leaked into Colombia's waterways, and enviromental activists are saying an oil company is to blame

​	At the beginning of March, an oil well in northern Colombia burst, spewing an unclear amount of oil into the Megdalena River, a principal waterway that flows about 950 miles northward through the western half of the country. Over the next month, reports say the crude killed more than 2400 animals, including cattle, fish, birds, and reptiles,in the department of Santander. More than 1000 tree species in the area have been damaged, and familes have been relocated and treated for vomiting, headaches, and dizziness associated with the spill.

​	I have practically nothing to eat, we have lived throuhg the river all our lives and the contamination has already reached the Magdalena, one resident tells local media.

​	Conservationists say this environmental disaster is the worst the country has seen in decades, and the number of barrels spilled is unclear.Ecopetrol, the state-owned oil company that some environmental activists are blaming for the spill,says there were 550 barrels of crude spilled, but some local outlets are reporting that as many as 24000 barrels were spilled.

​	Although Ecopetrol says nearly 1250 animals have been rescued and the spill is under control, the crude continues to flow, locals say. So far, it's seeped about 15 miles to contaminate the Lizama and Sogamoso Rivers. An investigation of the cause of the leak is ongoing, and few details have been revealed.

​	Oil spills often have lasting effects, and the country has had other environmental problems . Last week, a report revealed that Colombia's Cauca River, which is south-west of the spill site, is unsafe for humans. According to the Cali-based newpaper EL Pais, carcinogenic heavy metals have been found in fish species eaten by humans.

​	Oil spills don't discriminate geographically.In 2013, a train carrying crude catastrophically derailed in Canada, killing people, destroying buildings, and of course,spewing oil.In 2010, the infamous Deepwater Horizon oil spill leaked more than 200 million gallons into the Gulf of Mexico, it the worst spill in US history.

​	The Colombia oil spill mirrors several that happened in Peru in 2016, which researcher and National Geographic Explorer Rebecca Wolff covered as an independent journalist. Some reports say that more than  450 local people sought medical attention for health problems related to oil contamination, but others likely suffered without treatment.

​	When oil spills happen, just coming into contact with oil in the short term has incredibly horrible side-effects, Wolff says.

​	Oil spills not only affect the flora and fauna of the environment, but farmland as well. Contaminated fields prevent locals from cultivating the land, and chemically poisoned fish—a protein packed dietary staple—must be taken out of the diet.

​	In addition to the symptoms reported by the Colombian locals, people suffering from oil contamination can experience respiratory issues,skin rashes, fatigue, and seemingly undiagnosted illnesses lasting months or years. Spill-related condictions can also kill children.

​	Wolff adds  that it can take days for local government to get involved right after a spill, so community members are often left to try to clean up their environment without adequate protection. Not enough studies have been done on the lasting consequences of oil spills, she says, since government intervention normally stops 60 days after the initial spill.

​	There is continual danger for years and years of what's in the fish and what's in the water, Wolff says. If you ruin the water and the land that people depend on , their livelihood is gone.

##HOPE FOR THE FUTURE

​	Local and international attention can shed light on oil spills and their consequences,ultimately helping conmunities recover over time.

​	Usually, people are just really angry or upset for a long time to come, Wolff says.She adds that cases locals brought to court about the Peruvian oil spills kind of sent the message to the country that people were not  OK with this.

​	She says long-term medical care and financial support are crucial for helping communites respond to these types of disasters,as are support and recognition from the goverment.

​	The world needs to pay better attention and have better response plans, Wolff says.all over the world , but I don't think we've come to a way to respond and support afterwards.

# A Running List of How Trump Is Changing the Environment

> The Trump administration has promised vast changes to US science and environmental policy-and we're tracking them here as they happen.

​	The Trump administration's tumultuous first year has brought a flurry of changes-both realized and anticipated to US environmental policy.Many of the actions roll back Obama-era policies that aimed to curb climate change and limit environmental pollution, while others threaten to limit federal funding for science and the environment.

​	It's a lot to keep track of , so National Geographic will be maintaining an abbreviated timeline of the Trump administration's environmental actions and policy changes , as well as reactions to them. We will update this article periodically as new develops.

	## EPA STARTS ROLLBACK OF CAR EMISSIONS STANDARDS

​	In a press release ,EPA administrator Scott Pruitt announced that the US  goverment would revisit the Obama administration's fuel effciency standards for cars and light-duty trucks-the first step in a  rollback of one the US biggest efforts to curb carbon emissions.

​	In July 2011, President Obama announced he would tighten regulations of vehicle greenhouse gas emissions, with rules that first finalized in August 2012.Under Obama fuel efficiencies equivalent to 545 miles per gallon by model year 2025

​	About a sixth of US greenhouse gas emissions in 2016 came from passenger cars and light-duty trucks. Overall , the Obama program would've reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 6 billion metric tons-more than the total CO the US emitted in 2016.

​	The EPA commited to finishing a midterm evaluation of the 2022–2025 standards by no later than April 1, 2018 .On January 12, 2017, outgoing Obama EPA administrator Gina MaCarthy finalized the evaluation and reaffirmed the stringent emissions standards.

​	At the time, car manufacturers argued that the 2022-2025 standards were unrealistic , expensive, and politically rushed.The Trump administration has enthusiastically echoed these sentiments; it restarted the midterm evaluation in March 2017.

​	The Obama administration's determination was wrong. Pruitt said in a statement.Obama 's EPA cut the Midterm Evaluation process short with politically charged expediency, made assumptions about the standards that didn't comport with reality, and set the standards too high.

​	Automakers struck a guardedly pleased tone in release about the announcement, seemingly leery that they be getting more rollbacks out of  the Trump EPA than they originaly bargained for.Already, environmental and public health groups are voicing fierce opposition.

​	Starting a process to weaken clean car standards marks yet another step backward from the fight to curb climate change, said Harold P Wimmer, the national president and CEO of the American Lung Association, in a statement.Climate change poses serious threats to millions of people, especially to some of the most vulnerable Americans , including children, older adults and those living with chronic disease as asthma.

# Why This Giant Crack Opened Up In Kenya

> The region has yielded a trover of archaeological finds in the past and may border a new continent 50 million years in the future.

​	Mai Mahiu-Narok road, in a region just west of Nairobi, Kenya,used to be fully intact.

​	Then, after a period of heavy rainful late last month, a massive crack was exposed . According to the local news outlet, Daily Nation,it measures 50 feet deep and 65 feet wide in some spots.

​	Geologist David Adede, who spoke with the paper , said the crack was likely filled previously with volcanic ash from nearby Mt. Longonot.This  means the  space was only exposed when rainwater washed the ash away.

​	Reuters reports that the opening formed rapidly. One resident named Eliud Njoroge Mbugua saw the crack run through his home. He was only narrowly able to collect some of his belongings before his house collapsed.

​	So what caused the break in the first place?

## GREAT RIFT

​	The crack, only recently exposed from its hiding place in the Earth, in part of the Great Rift Valley.

​	The name is often used to refer to a cultural region from the Middle East to Mozambiqeu,but is not actually connected to the same unit.Rather it's made of multiple rifts all running through the same system.

​	A rift valley refers to a lowland region where tectonic plates rift, or  move apart.The large crack that recently exposed itself in Kenya is from the East African Rift.In the 3700 mile-long East African Rift, there are two smaller systems called the Gregory Rift and the Western Rift, and each is speckled with volcanoes.

​	The rifts are growing larger as two tectonic plates, the Somali plate in the east and the Nubian plate in the west , move away from each other.

​	The region has yielded some of history's most important archaeological finds and has been nicknamed the cradle of humanity. Turkana boy. a 1.5 million year-old hominin skeleton was found there. It's an important piece of evidence for scientists piecing together our prehistoric past.

​	While it's one of the largest, the East African Rift isn't the only geological formation of its kind.Eastern Russia is home to the Baikal Rift Valley, and Antarctica is separated by the West Antarctic Rift.

​	In the US the southwest is sliced by the Rio Grande Rift Valley , which stretches from Chihuahua, Mexico to Colorado.It's formation, roughly 30 million years ago, is responsible for the Rio Grande River bordering the southern US.

# Go Beyond the Beach in Grenada

> The dramatic landscapes of this volcanic island in the Caribbean beg to be explored

​	While many area of the Caribbean are still recovering from 2017's devastating hurricanes, Grenada escaped any damage and is a hotter destination than ever. The former British colony boasts dramatic mountainous  landscapes and a rich spice-producing heritage.Here are the top five reasons to visit this volcanic isle.

## HISTORIC ST. GEORGE'S

​	Grenada's capital, founded by the French in 1650,is a charming jumble of stone buildings with colorful facades that rise along steep hills around the deep Inner Harbour. The imposing Catholic cathedral dominates the skyline, while the harbor waterfront, known as the Carenage is lined with restored George, a 300-year-old fortress with working cannons ,for 360-degree views of the city, harbor, and Caribbean Sea. For a unique underwater adventure , dive trips frequently depart St. George's for the Underwater Sculpture Garden in nearby Molinere Bay, where dozens of human figures in whimsical poses from a fascinating artificial reef that attracts a wide array of sealife.

## WINDWARD COAST

​	While tourists flock to hotspots such as Grand Anse Beach south of ST. George's, go off the beaten path to Grenada's rugged Atlantic coast. Back roads will bring you to hidden coves with golden beaches bare of footprints and coral reefs just offshore that are perfect for snorkeling. Stay at Cabier Ocean Lodge, an eco-friendly resort perched on a peninsula between two bays, where the soft roar of the waves sounds all night long. The on-site restaurant, Bruno's has a seaside terrace shaded by mango trees and serves up passionfruit mojitos and Grenadian favorites such as callaloo soup, a creamy soup made from the green leaves of the callaloo plant.

## WATERFALL SPLENDOR

​	Grenada is especiallly rich in waterfalls that tumble down its volcanic slopes. The highest is Royal Mount Carmel Falls, a spectacular cascade that pours 70 feet over a  sheer rock wall . Local guides lead visitors a trail through lush greenery that opens up to a breathtaking view of the falls. Don't forget to bring your swimsuit- a broad natural swimming pool at the base invites taking a dip, welcome after the hot jungle walk.

## SPICE ISLE

​	A British import in the 19th century, nutmeg trees flourished in Grenada's tropical climate, and the small island now produces almost a third of the world's supply of nutmeg.Cinnamon, cloves , mace, and ginger also exported, as well as organic Grenadian chololate that's grown and diectly produced from the island's many cacao farms. Spice naturally plays a large part in Grenadian cuisine—don't miss farms.Spice naturally plays a large part in Grenadian cuisine—don't miss trying nutmeg ice cream or nutmeg jelly —and even medicine. Hit up the Spice Market in ST George's for a vast array of spices, or travel farther afield to Grenville's local market, where you can find fresh ginger, coconuts, passionfruit, and blocks of chocolate.On the west side of the island, tour the Gouyave Nutmeg Station, where you can watch sorting and packaging.

# Famous Japanese Snow Monkeys Take Baths to Lower Stress

> Just like us, snow monkeys may cope with winter weather by taking warm baths, a new study found.

​	There's a reason macaques look so serene in their photos. Submerged up to their cheeks in steamy water with sonw drifting onto their furry heads-they look almost meditative.

​	Researchers always suspected the monkeys used the hot springs to stay warm in the winter, and a new study published in the journal Primates confirms this.While the researchers suspected this was the case, the finding could still illuminate how the monkeys cope with stress.

​	Of all the primates in the world, Japanese macaques live the farthest north.For decades , they've been observed taking baths in Jigokudani Monkey  Park in Japan. Their behavior has becom so endearing to people that thousands of tourists often trek north to take a peak at the snow monkeys' bath time.

​	In the mountainous regions of Japan, winters can be harsh. While the monkeys are lounging in a calm pool of water, they're often subjected to intense snowfall  and freezing temperatures. 

​	To see exactly what kind of  benefit the macaques got from their baths, a group of researchers from Japan's Kyoto University tracked 12 females. Their bahavior was observed in two different seasons: their birth season, from April to June, and their winter season, from October to December.The scientists looked at which monkeys bathed the most often and for how long.

​	They then measured the amount of a  hormone called glucocoricoid from the monkeys' fecal samples. Glucocoritcoids come from a family of steroid hormones and are produced when the monkeys undergo stress—ofen from trying to maintain a body temperature that's not too cold and not too hot.

## SOOTHING BATHS

​	The team's results confirmed that the monkeys used the hot springs more frequently during winter months. Females who had higher social standing were documented taking longer baths

​	When the researchers then measured the amount of glucocorticoid in females who took longer baths, they found lower levels of the stress hormone than in famales who hadn't bathed at all. This means the females experienced less stress from trying to regulate their body temperatures.

​	Whether the long baths influenced other stress hormones is unclear.Researchers plan to next study saliva samples to measure other hormones related to stress. They theorize that, by lowering stress, the baths could benefit the macaques' likelihood to reproduce and thus ensure their survival.

# Pakistan's Most Wild and Beautiful Places

> Journey from the Arabian Sea to the ivory cones of the Himalayas.

​	From the precipitous peaks of the Karakoram range to the fertile Indus River plain, Pakistan is home to a diversity of stunning landscapes . While its rich cultural heritage, ancient Silk Road, and ruins of Moenjo-daro continue to enchant travelers, wenture further afield and discover a lesser-known, wilder Pakistan.

## DEOSAI NATIONAL PARK

​	Known as Land of the Giants, a backdrop of snow-dusted mountains rises from the alpine plateau of Deosia National Park. Each spring, the lush valley is swept by wildflowers and rare butterflies, earning the name Summer's Places by locals, who enjoy the wildlife after winter's thaw. This biodiversity hot spot is home to the Tibetan wolf, Himalayan ibex, Tibetan red fox, and golden marmots, but the government granted the park protected status in 1993 with the goal of safeguarding the critically endangered Himalaan brown bear. The park was also nominated for World Heritage status in 2016.

## KAGHAN VALLEY

​	Northern Pakistan's picturesque Kaghan Valley is a place of fairytales.According to one version of a local legend, a prince of Persia fell in love with a fairy princess on the crystalline waters of Lake Saiful Muluk, pictured above. But a giant was also in love with the princess, and held her captive.One day , the prince escaped with her , and in his fury, the giant flooded the valley and created lakes with his tears.Today, visitors from around the world travel to Kaghan Valley for its alpine lakes, mountain scenery , and clear night skies.

## MAKRAN COAST

​	The Makran Coastal Highway is a scenic drive along Pakistan's Arabian Sea coast. The route starts in Karachi and runs through Gwadar to the Iran border, and is considered a major infrastuctual acheevement.Unique, lunar rock formations line a section of the highway known as the Buzi Pass in Hingol National Park. Natural rock sculptures, like the sphinx-shaped Lion of Balochistan, can be found along the highway.

## HUNZA

​	In the nothern territory of Gilgit- Baltistan , icy peaks stretch above the Hunza River. Situated on the riverbank and surrounded by glaciers and gorges, the town of Hunza traditionally served as a  resting place for  travelers descending the Hindu Kush mountains into the Vale of Kashmir. The valley is home to snow leopards , markhors, ibexes,and red-striped foxes.

## HINGOL NATIONAL PARK

​	Pakistan's largest national park extends hundreds of miles along the Makran Coast. While Hingol Naitonal Park is renowned for its diverse wildlife—Sindh leopards, chinkaras, honey badgers, and Indian pangolins—it is perhaps best known for its cluster of active mud volcanoes . A mix of hot spring activity, gas, and water react chemically with the surrounding rocks to form a boiling mud. When the mud is expelled, it continuously rebuilds the cones, which are easily eroded. One of the most famous mud volcanoes is Chandragup , a sacred annual pilgrimage site for thousands of Hindus , along with the nearby Hinlaj temple.

## BALTORO GLACIER

​	In Pakistan's eastern Karakoram, Baltoro Glacier is one of the world's largest valley glaciers. Though diffcult to access, it is one of the most highly trafficked regions in Pakistan because of mountaineering destinations like K2, Broad Peak, and the Gasherbrum peaks at its head. The area is not only known for its stunning scenery , but as a life source— a large protion northern Pakistan's population depends on meltwater from the Karakoram glaciers.

## NEELUM VALLEY

​	In northern Azad Kashmir, the bow-shaped Neelum Valley is sandwiched between 13000-foot peaks and blanketed by verdant forest and streams.The small hilltop village of Arang Kel, pictured above,is known as the pearl of Neelum Valley.

## ATTABAD LAKE

​	Nestled in the Hunnza Valley, attabad Lake's vibrant turquoise waters cut through the rocky terrain. Though beautiful, the serene landscape has a violent origin story. The lake was formed in January 2010,when a massive landslide at Attabad Village flooded nearby towns, blocked the flow of the Hunza River, and displaced thousands of people . Today , it's a popular stop for tourists who can take boats out on the water.

# Luxury Space Hotel Could Cater Travelers by 2022

> Soon after launch in 2021, the startup Orion Span hopes to send up extraterrestrial condos to capialize on open space.

​	With all the madness going on here on Earth, have you ever thought about going into space? Well , for a couple million dollars, you might be able check off that bucket list-worthy to-do in the next four years.

​	Orion Span, a Houston-based space tech startup, has announced plans to launch the first-ever luxury space hotel into Earth's orbit by 2021. The company says the so-called Aurora Station will be ready to accommodate visitors the following year.

​	The price of a ticket for a 12-day stay will be 9.5 million per person, which comes to 7898 per night.

## NOT YOUR AVERAGE SPACE STAY

​	Orion Span has yet to contract with a launch provider to put future visitors—and the station—into orbit. In the past, private citizens have been seen to the International Space Station on 20 to 40 million round-trip tickets, but according to Frank Bunger, the company's founder and CEO, Orion Span's trips are less expensive because of declining launch prices. Right now, prospective flyers can put down an 8000 refundable deposit for future stays.

​	Upon launch, Aurora Station goes into service immediately, bringing travelers into space quicker and a lower price point than ever seen before, Bunger says in a statement . Our goal is to make space accessible to all, by continuing to driver greater value at a lower cost.

​	The hotel, which is slated for  launch into low Earth orbit at around 200 miles from the Earth's surface, will be about the size of the cabin of a large private jet. Company representatives say it will be roughly 43 feet long by 14 feet wide, with a pressurized volume of 5650 cubic feet. By comparison , the ISS in much larger, at 357 feet long , an internal pressurized volume of 3223 cubic feet, and soars 250 miles above Earth .

​	Completed,Aurora Station will be fully modular and  host six people at a time with private, two-person suites. Four of those people will be guests and two will be crewmembers who are most likely former astronauts, the company says. With the help of engineers who have worked on the ISS , the hotel is currently in construction in Housten,while Orion Span develops software for it in the Bay Area.

# Meet the Beetles that Harvest Fog in the Desert

> It's just one weird way animals drink.

​	What's the one thing no life form can do without?

​	It's not coffee, a smartphone, or even Netflix. It's water. Every living thing needs it, but we have surprisingly differnet ways of ingesting it.

​	Here are some peculiar ways different animals enjoy a drink.And no, pickle margaritas are not on here.

## LAP DOG

​	Monkeys and other apes lean down to drink, says Don Moore, director of the Oregon Zoo in Portland, but  the southest Asian gibbons drink water through cupped hands , a very cool behavior, especially if these acrobats are hanging upside down in a tree.

​	Dogs also form a cup-sort of —with their tongues.

​	Research from Virginia Tech in 2015 found they curl their tongues toward themselves in  a kind of ladle. A column of water splashes upwards , and they grab that while taking in what tongue catches.

​	When snakes drink , it doesn't look like they are doing much of anything, Moore says, but there's a lot going on behind the scenes.

​	In a 2012 study David Cundall of Lehigh University and colleagues found that some species drink via capilary action, the same mechanism by which water climbs from roots to leaves in plants.

​	Snakes have skin folds in their lower jaw that expand to accommodate large prey. When they put their mouths in the water, those skin folds expand and absorb the liquid like a sponge via capillary aciton, then muscles squeeze it down into the gut.

## WATER IN THE DESERT

​	Where there's little water to be had, animals come up with very innovative ways to collect it.

​	The sandgrouse, a relative of the pigeon , lives in arid parts of Africa,Madagascar, southern Europe, and southern and Central Asia. The way the male feeds is  chicks is so extraordinary it was once believed to be a myth.

​	Each day, the male commutes to a water hole, where he'll sit and rock back and forth . He's soaking up water in his specialized belly feathers, which have a coiled barbule which makes them extra spongey. They can hold up to 1.35 ounces, or 2.7 tablespoons , compared to other birds at .0002 ounces.

​	The papa sandgrouse then returns to the nest , bringing back water for his young in his soaked feathers.

​	For Australian thorny devils, spikey lizards up to almost eight inches long, morning dew collects on bodies, and it drips through skin grooves toward the mouth where the creatures can slurp it up, Moore says. They'll throw moist sand on their backs to extract water in the same way, it's believed.

​	Thorny devils can also drink through their feet, a 2016 study found. Microstructures between their scary scales act like little straws, using the force of capillary action to pull in water from moist sand.

​	Other desert dwellers pull water right out of the air.

​	The Namibian desert beetle has this complex micro-sculpture on its exoskeleton where it will collect dew from the air, say Katy Prudic , an extomologist at the University of Arizona . 

​	When fog rolls into the desert, about six times a month, the beetle will stand with its butt in the air, letting those structures on its back capture moisture and funel it down into their mouths.

# Three Billionaires Are Racing to Space. Who Will Win?

> Elon Mush is eyeing Mars, Jeff Bezons aims for the moon, Richard Branson is all about space tourism.Some say they should save Earth first.

​	They've all ridiculously rich , they're all men, and now they all have their sights set on the stars.Elon Mush wants to fly to Mars.Jeff Bezos,of Amazon, dreams of putting a colony on the moon. And Richard Branson wants to offer luxury space tourism under the Virgin banner.

​	What motivates these men? And shouldn't they be spending their billions to make this planet a better place? Speaking from his home in Washington, DC,Christian Davenport, author of The Space Barons, reveals the intense competition that animates these billionaires;discussce their different visions for exploring the cosmos; and explains why women are still so underrepresented in space.

​	They're very different. Elon Mush is a marketing genius who gets a lot of  attention from the media, a lot of it self-generated. By contrast, Bezos is much quieter and more clandestine.His project, Blue Origin, has been secretive for  many years. Most people don't realize it's been around since 2000 and that's precisely how Bezos wants it.

​	Elon has come out of the gate very early and tired to get a lot of attention. In 2003, he took mock-up of his Falcon One rocket and paraded it down on the National Mall in  Washington to try to get the attention of NASA. From the beginning, he was out trying to get attention and move very quickly with his company. Bezos's motto is , Slow is smooth and smooth is fast.He 's content to be very deliberate and patient, and take his time to work through the steps methodically, out of the limelight and public eye.

## One of the drivers for these space barons is a belief that the Earth is headed for extinction, so they want their own, private stairway to heaven. Shouldn't they, like Bill Gates, be putting their billions into making this planet better?

​	That's a great question. Elon Mush in particular has said that if something should happen to Earth, if there was some extinction event, like an asteroid hit the Earth, or humanity was to go the way of the dinosaurs, we should have a backup plan, like putting humainity on Mars, backing up the human race the way you back up your computer on a hard drive.

​	Jeff Bezos thinks about it a little differently.He says that Plan B should be to make sure that Plan A works; that Earth should be preserved and protected . The way to do that is to go to space because Earth has limited resources— there's only so much coal and fuel and gas— but space has unlimited resources.

​	But I think it's worth debating: is space the best use of their funds? Their motivations are varied. There's this motivation to do something better for humanity, there are economic motivations, there's the rivalry between them, then there's this simple goal that they just want to go to space as an adventure.

## The third space baron once signed the Sex Pistols to his record label and has the motto , Screw it, let's do it. Tell us about Richard Branson and his Virgin Galactic program.

​	Branson has done all sorts of crazy adventures . He flew a balloon across the Pacific ,as part of marketing his global Virgin brand , with the idea to land in Southern California, but they crashed into a frozen lake in Canada. Another time, he tired to aross the Atlantic from Maine to the UK but his pilot ended up bailing out, leaving Richard all by himself to bring the thing down.

​	Virgin Galactic wants to take tours flying to the edge of space in a cool-looking, sexy spacecraft called Spaceship 2, tethered toa mother ship. It would fly to about 35000–4000 feet, the pilots would ignit the engines, and off you would go , shooting into space. Tickets cost about 25000 ,but the  idea is that eventually the cost of the ticket would go down so that you could start getting regular people going up into space. You would unbuckle from your seatbelt and float around the cabin, look out the window, see the curvature of the Earth-that transformative view that astronauts have been talking about for decades.

​	But it's not come as quickly or as easily as Branson though. It's had multiple setbacks and delays, including a fatal crash in 2014, which killed one of the pilots. But Virgin Galactic has continued to press on with their program and we could see the first flights start as soon as  this year.

## A space rocket is , of course , the ultimate phallic symbol. And reading your book I couldn't help feeling that, ultimately, this is like a schoolyard bragging contest for rich men: Mine is bigger than yours! Or am I being facile?

​	Competition is key to this . It's what got us to the moon in the Apollo era, going up against the Soviet Union. NASA as the time got a lot of funding, but was essentially an adjunct of the Pentagon and the space race was in some ways a military program. Since then, we have been sending astronauts to the International Space Station, but that's only 250 miles away. It's an amazing engineered object, but it's not as ambitious as going to the moon.

​	What these billionaires have done is inject competition back into the space industry and created a new space race. At times, it's gotten tense between them.There have been lawsuits, harsh word on Twitter, and a lot of  back and forth. But ultimately, I think they realize that they need each other, that competition is  good. It will make them more effcient, safer, and more innovative.

​	There is definitely something about having a big rocket. They obviously have huge egos and ambitions, and there's no bigger ambition than space. It's such a challenge; it requires not just an immense amount of resources, but guts and courage, because the  chances of failure are so high.

# How Do You Protect Endangered Animals at Night? Ask an Astrophysicist.

> To covertly watch animals targetd by poachers, this team of scientists wants to send in the drones.

​	What do animals and galaxies have in common ? Under a thermal  infrared camera, they both glow.

​	The similarity is now helping conservationists monitor endangered animals that are often targeted by poachers. By depolying small with infrared cameras attached, scientists are developing tools for wildlife officials to watch these wild animals without disturbing them.

​	At night, when poachers are most likely to strike, wildlife guards have a difficult time spotting animals in the dark. But on infrared cameras, they're impossible to miss. On video , the landscape appears a dull pink and purple color. In contrast, animals and humans—anything that gives off a heat source—appears yellow. The warmer an object, the brighter it appears.

​	The interdisciplinary research team conducted a separate trial last September, during which they went to South African to search for Riverine rabbits. The rabbits are one of the most endangered species of mammal in the world, and only about 1000 have been spotted ever.

​	Flying the drone 65 feet in the air, the researchers were able to see five rabbits on camera.

​	The drones were also tested at the Knowsley Safari and Chester Zoo near Liverpool , England. In video footage, bright yellow rhinos and elephants are easily spotted.

​	In addition to high-tech cameras, the system is supported by a machine learning program developed from an open-source software repository called Astropy. The software supports the camera by learning how to identify different tpyes of animals in various landscapes.

​	It's the same glow the galaxies have, says astrophysicist Claire Burke from Liverpool John Moores University in the UK Burke's work has focused more on search for the thermal glow of far—off galaxies, but she adapted the software to find endangered animals.

​	Once you've detected them , you can learn their thermal profile, she adds.

Knowing an animal's unique thermal profile, the software is then able to learn how to identify various species.

​	Burke says this information could also be used to take accurate population counts. Current methods rely on human counting or studying the remains, like nest, that animals leave behind.

​	The drones could also be used in search—and—rescue operations. Its cameras would ba able to see heat signatures through fog, a feat that's diffcult for human eyes. Injured or sick animals could also potentially be identified when they experience a spike in temperature.

​	The results of the software thus far were recently presented at an annual meeting of the European Astronomical Society.

​	Despite its potential, the sofeware still contains some limitations. Humidity has been noted as an issue, and warmer climates make the animals more diffcult to spot. When the ground is  warmer, the thermal images appear less distincet, so on camera, the animals don't pop.

## THE THREAT FROM POACHING

​	Despite the limitations , conservationists are excited about  how the technology could be used.

​	There's no shortage of demand for tools that can be used to stop poaching. Just a few weeks ago, Sudan, the last northern white rhino, died. Only two individuals both femals , remain of the sub-species. It was a reminder of the extent of damage poaching can have.

​	For the last year of his life , Sudan was under 24/7 armed guard.

​	Rhinos are aggressively poached. In the past year, more than 1000 were killed by poachers, a slight drop after an explosion of illegal poaching in the past decade.

​	In addition to guards and sniffer dogs, parks like Kruger National Park in South Africa have searched for high-tech methods to stop poachers. Sonar and movement-detecting senesors have been installed to the tune of nearly 6 million dollars.

​	Once May, the team of astronomers and ecologists will look for orangutans in Malaysia and spider monkeys in Mexico before heading to Brazil to search for river dolphins.

# This Man Has Helped Give 460 Dead Whales a Second Life-As Art

> Hori Parata handles dead whales on New Zealand beaches the Maori way: He extracts the bones so they can be carved into jewelry or art.

​	When Hori Parata talks to a dead whale on a New Zealand beach, he welcomes it home. It is returning to where it was born , he says.

​	The earliest whales walked on land— evolutionary biologist learned this from fossils that show a four—legged land animal gradually evolving into a mariine mammal around 50 million years ago. Parata 75 learned it from his elders among the Ngatiwai, a Maori tribe of northern New Zealand. The forest god Tane, they said , noticed that the whale , then a land animal, liked rivers and marshes—wet places. So Tane gave whales as a gift to Tangaroa, the ocean god.

​	Parata is a Ngatiwai environmental resource manager, and for him a dead whale on a beach isn't just a smelly and potentially hazardous mess. It's a gift from the sea.

​	Over the last 21 years he has flensed, or carved up, nearly 500 dead whales and other cetaceans on New Zealand beaches. He and a team of helpers remove the flesh and discard it, then clean the bones and teeth,which they distribute to Maori groups. Many of the bones end up as jewelry or staffs carved in the distinctive flowing, openwork style of Maori art, which often features fierce and beautiful stylized human fugures, spirals ,and fishhooks.

​	Flensing today is a political statement—a very visible expression of Maori management of the environment, after generations of New Zealand's European settlers doing things their way. Maori harvest of dead whales has only been recognized as legal since 1998.

​	But for Parata, each dead whale is also an individual. As he welcomes it home, he tells it, Your traveling in  the ocean is finished. Your life in the flesh is finished. We are going to give you a second life in the bone.

## VERY LARGE GODSENDS

​	Around the world , and not just among the Maori, beached whales used to be considered boons. In Iceland, the word havlreki means a godsend—but it  literally translates as stranded whale. In Iceland these days, whale carcasses are sometimes towed back out to sea and sunk, says Gisli Vikingsson, head of cetacean research at the Marine and Freshwater Research Institute.

​	The situation is much the same in the United States, where 589 large whales were confirmed stranded and dead between 2007 and 2017, according to  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Beyond  the sadness, the dead whales are seen as a nasty, smelly problem, especially since the bacteria on their skin can ba dangerous to humans.

​	Occasionally they are towed out to sea. If they wash up in remote areas, far from people , they are often left to rot. On busy beaches a backhoe may be brought in to bury them. Since an infamous incident in Oregon in 1970, managers have wisely opted not to blow up dead whales with dynamite.

​	In New Zealand , several hundred whales and dolphins come up onto beaches each year, according to a charity that to save them, Project Jonah. A year ago, 650 pilot whales came at Farewell Spit. Despite the efforts of thousands of volunteers, most died.

​	The reasons for beaching are many, from confusion due to noise pollution in the sea to simply being caught by a fast—moving tide. In many cases, no one can tell why a whale came ashore. But Parata says the Maori have an explanation.

​	A sick whale keeps sinking down, he says If a whale is on its own, it will head for the shore where it can lie on the bottom with its head out the water so it can breathe. Our elders tell us that one of the reasons they strand is that when they are hurt, they are scard of drowning.

## CUTTING FOR BONE

​	When Parata's team arrive at the scene, they fill out paperwork and collect a tissue sample for lab testing with staff from the New Zealand Department of Conservation . Then wearing protective suits that flap in the brisk ocean breeze, they get down to the more physical work.

​	They sharpen their blades and say a prayer, circled around the massive hulk of the whale. Hands covered in thick black gloves, they saw through the gray, mottled skin and into the pink blubber. Although a fresh whale cuts like butter, Parata say, decayed ones are stiff and difficult to cut into and harbor bacteria that can cause a nasty infection if they get into a wound . Hence the gloves and the suits, which quickly become sodden with gore.

​	Working section by section , the team use huge metal hooks to peel back the flesh and expose the massive , sculptural whale bones.The  flesh and intestines are buried on the beach and the fat is redered —cooked slowly—to extract its oil. Once the bones have carved out, they'll buried under a couple feet of clean sand, so maggots and other insects can find them and thoroughly clean them . The cleaning takes six months or a year, after which the bones are dug up, blasted with water, and then left to dry in the sun a few days.

​	As they work, Parata and his team also talk to curious passersby. Many people feel an impulse to touch the whale. If you need to we will give you a pair of gumboots and some gloves to touch it, Parata says.

​	If it takes more than a day to extrac all the bones, a member of Parata's team will sleep on the sand, guarding the whale—because sometimes public interest goes  beyond curiosity. Round about the time we were developing our protocol, people began chainsawing off the jaw or cutting a hole in the belly to get the amberis, Parata says. Ambergris, a substance sperm whales produce as part of their digestion, is a are and expensive  ingredient of prefumes.

​	At the end, the team will bill DOC for the cost the operation. The government happily pays, since  the harvest also has the effect of dealing with a potential health threat and public nuisance.

​	We rely heavily on his expertise, says Aaron Taikato , tribal relationships manager for DOC. It is about ensuring that the mama of the whale is kept intact. Mana, a complex Maori concept, refers to the honor, responsibilty , power, and authorty held by a perosn or thing , inherited and earned.

# How One Country Is Restoring Its Damaged Ocean

> Belize was criticized for putting its stunning coral  reefs and other marine resources at risk. The country responded with innovative solutions.

​	Belize City—the Astrum helicopter company launches from a base less than five miles from where Belize City meets the Caribbean. In the backseat , to my left, is Belizean Senator Valerie Woods. Across from us are two representatives from international ocean protection organization Oceana, which organized the flight, The country's minister of state, Carla Barnett, climbs into the front seat.

​	I haven't been in a helicopter for a long time, she mutters, pulling on her headset. The doors shut , and we're off.

​	As we rise above the trees, Belize City starts to spread out in front of us . But that's not our destination. Side-skirting downtown, we head out over the water —where the ture treasures lay.

​	The Mesoamerican Reef stretches some 700 miles from Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula through Guatemala, to Honduras' Bay Islands. For 184.5 miles, the reef passes through Belizean waters. Along with the lagoons and atolls on either side of the main reef, the  collection is known as the Belize Barrier Reef System.

​	Heading out over the water, we almost immediately fly over a manatee serve. The Oceana country director, Janelle Chanona, tries to point one below , but I miss it. Crossing over the reef—a thick ribbon of turquoise —we come to the Turneffe atoll, which is one of the country's seven marin protected areas .In the middle of the coral—ring is a lake of darker water. Tannins from the surrounding mangrove trees cause the color, Chanona explains—though, the trees are being chopped down at a rapid rate.

​	The pilot does a 360 over Turneffe, then keeps going Now we're coming up to the Lighthouse Reef atoll, Chanona says, also pointing out the Glover Reef atoll in the distance. As we near Lighthouse Reef, the water is so clear that we see a group of eagle rays and nurse sharks swimming below us. The official welcome committee, she jokes.

​	In his book Coral Reefs of The World, Charles Darwin called Belize home to the most remarkable reef in the West Indies. As we head further out, the turquoise alternates with various shades of blue. You can see the coral and rock formations through the water. The mosaic is mesmerizing.

​	The colors get me every single time , said Chanona, staring out at the Caribbean . From the front seat, Barnett agrees. It's gorgeous.

​	In 1996, Unesco designated the Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System a World Heritage Site, with the former British colony responsible for protection. It's a mandate that country has at times struggled with . By 2009, the site was on UNESCO's danger list, with the organization syaing that the country needed to enact better management and safeguards. But since that low point , Belize has worked to turn things around. And ocean conservation observers say there has been impressive progress. Hence the helicopter flight, which was a victory lap of sorts.	

​	Just this December, Belize became the first country in the world to put a moratorium on all offshore oil exploration and drilling. Oceana had arranged the helicopter to help give politicians a sense of what they had protected, and what still needs to be done. I'm really looking forward to getting off the endangered list , Chanona said.

## HEALTHIER REEF

​	A day before the helicopter flight, the Healthy Reef for Healthy People Initiative issued its latest report card on the state of the Mesoamerican Reef. The report uses four metrics to assess:live coral, fleshy macroalgae, commercial fishing, and herbivorous fish.In the ten years since the report was first issued, the overall health of the Mesoamerican Reef has improved from a 2.3 to 2.8. Belize is currently at  2.8 as well. The sale, however, is out of 5.0

​	Some argue that improvement should be faster. But reefs across the world are us against unprecedented threats, from development to climate change . So , the country's slow creep is , in many ways, a step forward. Still a ways to go , Chanona said, when Barnett asked  about the report. But better than going the other direction.

​	Many of Belize's gains are tangible . There are ,for example, special environmental taxes here  that go directly to conservation and a booming eco-tourism market. In 2008, when the International Society for Reef Studies recommended that Mesoamerican Reef countries better protect parrot fish along the  reef, Belize was the first to respond with a law restricing their catch. The change is already showing up in HRI data.

# Close Call: How Howard Carter Almost Missed King Tut's Tomb

> British backer Lord Carnarvon wanted to call off the search for the lost tomb of Tutankhamun after six fruitiless years of searching , But Howard Carter convinced him to stick it out for one  more season— resulting in the 20th century's most famous find.

​	A hush fell on the group of British and Egyptian observers standing at the sealed doorway on November 26, 1922. Three weeks earlier, British archaeologist Howard Carter and his team had stumbled on a rubble—filled stairway in the Valley of the King in Egypt.

​	Following the exacvations of the late 1800s many archaeologists thought the valley had yielded all its secrets. However, Carter had a hunch that there was still more to find . Egyptians began to bury their royalty in the Valley of the Kings during the New Kingdom . Carter was searching for the tomb of an obscure king from the 18th dynasty. The boy king has since become Eygpt's most famous pharaoh, but when Carter was digging, his name-tutankhamen—was only spoken in scholarly circles.

​	Having cleard the debris from the stairs, Carter's team revealed the top of a doorway, sealed with plaster. Upon it were the undisturbed seals of the royal necropolis, a sight that made Carter's heart race with excitement. After ordering the staircase filled in, Carter sent a cable to his patron —the wealthy Lord Carnarvon—that said: At last have made wonderful discovery in valley; a magnificent tomb with seals intact.

​	Carnarvon hurried to Egypt to wittness the opening of the tomb. As Carter and his team re-cleared the staircase to continue their work, the entire door was exposed, and the seals of Tutankhamun revealed. Carter's hunch was right. He had found the boy king. The door also bore signs of damage and repair, leading Carter to wonder if the tomb was indeed intact.

​	The next day, the team assembled to open the tomb. With Carnarvon and other observers looking on , Carter drilled a small hole in the top corner of the doorway and placed a candle inside. The candle flickered, and Carter peered in. As his eyes grew accustomed to the darkness beyond, he heard Carnarvon asking: Can you see anything?

​	Yes, Carter replied. Wonderful things. Wonderful things!

# This is Europe's Unsung Cultural Capital— and Picasso's Birthplace

> Inspired by his genius, the Spanish port city Malaga transformed itself into a cultural hub.

​	In a painting from 1889 , a bullfighter on horseback enters the ring under the watchful eyes of spectators, ready to face his opponent. The canvas is a study of silent drama with the protatonist dressed in gold and those in the world oversized yet refined. Displaying emotional control , the artist subtlety melds warm tones with just a pop of red, alluding to the ineviatable event to come. The  painter was only eight years old, and would later become one of the 20th century's most famous creative geniuses . Pablo Picasso's earliest surviving painting was more than just a promist of future creations, but serves as a reminder of the significance his Andalusian roots played throughtout his life.

​	Growing up in the  southern Spanish port city Malaga, he learned about bullfights and painting from his father Jose Ruiz Blasco, a talented fine art professor in the city. As the painter's artistic mentor, he influenced Picasso's understanding of art as both a profession and a personal challenge, explains the Artistic Director of the Museo Picasso Malaga, Jose Lebrero Stals. The student's talent surpassed that of the teacher from an early age, and young Pablo often put the final touches on his father's paintings of birds and other natural scenes.

​	Soon after that first painting , the Picasso family moved away Malaga when Pablo was 10. He spent his formative years in Barcelona and lived the rest of his life in France, yet he never forgot his birthplace. Although the artist was uprootd from his city of birth at a young age, now  and again we can make out certain formal solutions and symbolic resources in his  work that link it to the cultural and natural landscape of his  native land: from subjects typical of Catholic rhetoric to the presence of water and the Mediteranean Sea, says Stals.

​	Imagery from the bullfights he watched with his father appeared in artwork, like Guernica, throughout Picasso's entire career. Spanish poet Rafael Alberti writes that for Picasso, the bull becomes the symbol of the bravery of the Spanish pople , of their creative power. Andalusia is the home of bullfighting , with more than seventy bullrings in the region.

​	Spain's Costa del Sol always offered tourists an affordable beachside retreat near one of the oldest cities in the world. During its 2800-year history , Malaga was occupied by the Phoenicians , Romans, and the Arabs, all of whom left behind their own distinctive architecture and other influences.

​	The city fully embraced its most famous export when members of the Picasso family donated almost three hundred artworks in 2003. The city has

experienced a huge transformation since the opening of Picasso museum in Malaga. This was the starting point of the cultural and artistic evolution of the city. All the streets around the museum were renewed and the list of museums has grown to 36, says spokesperson Carmen Gualada Romero from the tourism board.

​	Malaga spent millions of euros to reinvent itself as a cultural hub. In 2015, the Parisian contemporary art museum Centre Pompidou opened its only foray outside France, housed in  a playful glass cube that catches the sun near the revitalized port. A collection of Russian art opened in a former tobacco factory the same year, which was also the first venture outside of Russia for the StateRussian Museum. Then there's the Malaga Museum in Aduana Palace, a satelite of Madrid's Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, the Center for Contemporary Art, and many galleries cropping up in the city's less-than-originally neamed Soho district.

​	More than a century after the Picassos left, the city built an identity around its most famous resident. Although Pablo never returned to Malaga after childhood, he left an enduring mark on the city, and indeed the trajectory of art itself.

# Turtle With Green Mohawk Faces Extinction

> On a list of endangered reptiles, the Mary turtle turned heads, but it's only one of many facing extinction.

​	Unbeknownst to the Mary river turtle, the Austraian species has been labelled a punk.

​	Perhaps it's the little green mohawk, made of algae strands that grow on its body, or the novel fact that it breathes through its genitals —but the Mary river turtle became a sensation after news came out that it was already on the road to extinction.

​	This week, conservation group EDGE—Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered— run by the Zoological Society of London updated their endangered species list. The organization ranks animals that are both at risk of extinction and evolutionarily distinct from other similar species.

​	The rankings are backed by a study published in the journal PLOS One , which outlines the criteria scientists use to evaluate each species.

​	EDGE is updated on an anual basis, but this year is special , says study author Rikki Gumbs, because it's the first time reptiles have been included.

​	The Mary river turtle waddled its way on the list for a number of reasons: it's the only member of its genius, and according to EGDE's website, it became evolutionarily distinct 40 million years ago. Forty million years of Earth's changes, however, wasn't enough to prepare them for 100 years of human intervention.

​	Their habitat—Mary River in Queensland , Austrialia—has been disrupted from dam construction, and the species was widely bought and sold in the pet trade.

​	Today it's protected by the Australian government, and conservation groups are working to make sure its habitat is preserved.

## OTHERS LIKE IT

​	It's important for people to not just focus on this one Mary river turtle, says Gumbs. Many more are threatened.

​	More than 100 species were added to EDGE's first reptile endangered list, and Gumbs estimates they represent only a fraction of  those at risk of extinction. Reptiles in general, he adds, have been underserved by conservation efforts. He thinks this is in part attributed to their sometimes less-than-cuddly appearance.

​	They freak a lot of people out, Gumb say. We can look at mammals and see things that remind us of ourselves, but the Mary river turtle is so unlike us.

​	His hunch is backed up by past studies saying cuter animals are treated favorably by conservationists and  that cuteness is a quantifiable cocktail of characteristics like big eyes and round faces.

​	In a blog post for EDGE, Gumb outlined his top 10 favorite reptiles recently added to the endangered list. The Mary river turtle isn't the only odd reptile on the list, nor is it even the only one that breathes through its butt.

​	The vulnerable pig-nose turtle has a little snout, two large nostrils, and wide flippers. It faces habitat loss in Australia, and in some countries it's eaten for its meat.

​	Snakes, like the rose gold Round Island keel-scaled boa and shimmery Madagascar blindsnake, are also in danger of extinction.

# How This New Probe Will Hunt for Alien Earths

> Once in orbit, the Transiting Exoplanet Survery satellite will find whole new worlds at the right distances for us  to spot signs of life.

​	On Monday, NASA's next plant hunter is slated to take to the skies aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched from Cape Canaveral, Floriada.

​	Barring malfunctions or delays, the Transiting Exoplanet Survery Satellite ,or TESS, weill settle into orbit and begin searching for planets around the nearest, brightest stars, building up our catalog of alien worlds that are close enough to be scrutinized for signs of life.

​	A few months after TESS launches , we will be able to point out the first ones of these familiar starts, which host planets that could be like ours, says Cornell University's Lisa Kaltenegger.

​	If a planet-hunting spacecraft sounds familiar, it's likely because of the rich deversity of worlds found so far by NASA's venerable Kepler space probe. Since 2009, Kepler has been harvesting planets from the cosmos, spying the footprints of these alien worlds in distance starlight. Kepler alone can claim more than 2600 discoveries, some of which could be rocky planets quite similar to Earth.

​	TESS won't be doing exactly the same thing as Kepler, says mission scientist Elisa Quintana of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Here's how the two missions stack up, and how TESS will help us probe the persasive question of whether we're alone in the universe.

## Why do we need more than one planet-hunting eye in the sky?

​	After nine years in orbit, the Kepler spacecraft is runing extremely low on fuel, and it will most likely cease operating within the next couple of months. It's an inevitability that scientists have been preparing for, but that doesn't make the spacecraft's end any easier. No one is looking forward to losing what has been the most successful planet-finder in history-a mission that revealed there are more planets in the sky than stars.

​	Even if Kepler did have a longer life span, more exoplanets are always better. What's more , TESS is looking for particular types of planet, rather than taking a broader census of what's out there.

​	I'm most excited about the large number of planets that are between the size of Earth and Neptune that TESS will find, Quintana says. These are the most abundant types of planets, and we know very little about them , because there are none in our solar system.

## So How will TESS find planets?

​	Like Kepler, TESS will be searching for planets that cross the faces of their stars from our perspective, causing their star's light to dim briefly. Those tell-tale dips in brightness not only reveal the presence of a planet, but also how wide that world is and how long it takes to orbit its star.

​	Unlike Kelper,which stared at a single patch of starry sky for most of its primary mission, TESS will be looking all over. As it zooms around Earth, the spacecreft will be using four cameras to gaze at a whopping 85 percent of the sky, focusing on particular stars for 27 days at most. Its first year of observations will focus on the southern sky, and its next year will map the north.

​	Before we knew what a huge number of fascinating, diverse planets were out there, the approach of scanning the sky and only looking at each star for a short time was too risky, Kaltenegger says. Now that Kepler showed us how many planets are out there, and also how many planets that could be like our own are out there, scanning the sky makes sense.

## Why do we care about these types of planets?

​	The search for life beyond Earth is necessarily constrained by what we know. Life as we don't know it could be anywhere, and it doesn't care that we haven't deigned to imagine it yet. To help focus the hunt, astronomers are starting by looking for something familiar. And we know that at least once, life evolved on a warm , rocky planet orbiting a relatively stable star.

# Where Did Picasso's Genius Come From?

> Pablo Picasso's talent was  fierce, dark, and revolutionary, but did it reach teh level of true genius? It's camplicated, a new book says.

​	On April 24, Antonio Banderas will strut his stuff as Pablo Picasso in the lastest installment of the National Geographic Channel's Genius series. As an appetizer, this week's Book Talk features a new book, Picasso and Painting That Shocked the World, which tells the story of how an impoverished Spanish painter from Barcelona exploded onto the Parisian cultural scene and changed the course of modern art with a single painting.

​	When National Geographic caught up with the author, Miles Unger, at his home near Boston, he explained Picasso's complicated relationship to money and fame; why his treatment of women was so awful; and how his masterpiece Les Demoiselles 'd Avignon took art in a revolutionary new direction and would become the cornerstone of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

	## The term genius has become debased through overuse today. But Picasso seems to genuinely merit it . What's your view?

​	I'm a little uncomfortable about the term genius because it does seem to be denuded of content. He was incredibly innovative and had enormous artistic courage. That's one of his qualities. Fewer famous people have painted as many horrible paintings as Picasso. That was intentional . He was not afraid of ugliness; in fact he was much more afraid of prettiness. He feared most of all to adhere to formula, to do something safe. He said that art had to be dangerous , to be offensive, to push boundaires, and he an enormous drive to do that. If you can call him a genius—and he certainly transformed the course of art, so in that sense it's valid—what it consists of is his enormous courage and defiance of rules.

​	One of the keys to his particular form of genius was that he knew the weaknesses of the enemy because he had been one of them.He'd been brought up in a very academic tradition by his father and givern a classical training, going through all the stages, from etching to classical sculptures. It's not that he discarded these tools, but he used them for very different purposes. You see his gift for draftsmanship and knowledge of the tools of art, but he took them apart and put them together in unexpected combinations. What distinguished him from other iconoclasts , though, was that he didn't simply tear down; he tore down in orderto build up again.

## We have to address Picasso's chauvinism, expecially now, in the age of MeToo. How should we view his attiudes and behavior toward women?

​	He came from a patriarchal family and part of the world in which women were expected to stay at home and take care of their husbands and children. Your social life revoled around men. Men were your intellectual and drinking companions . For sex, you went to the whorehouse, and occasionally came hometo your wife.So, as a lover and husband, I think he was horrible. He builded and demineered the women in his life. He famously said that women were either goddesses or doormats. Usually, they went from being goddesses to doormats.

​	Some people, when confronted with an artist like Picasso, say he was a great artist but a terrible human being, but that the two have nothing to do with each other. I think that's a mistake, particularly in the case of Picasso, because his attitudes toward women were so much a part of his art. If you look at Les Demoiselles D'Avignon, the fury and conflicted feelings about women all come through. That doesn't mean we should forgive his treatment of real women. But one should also recognize that art can often come from a very dark and furious place, just as Matisse's art came from a joyful, sensual, much-less-conflicted place.

## One of Picasso's contemporaries, Andre Salmon, said Les Demoiselles D'Avignon was The incandescent crater from which emerged the fire of present art. Talk us through the creation of  this iconic work.

​	In 1906,Matisse paints onheur de Vivre, or Joy of Life, which was a smash success and propelled Matisse to the forefront . So Picasso starts thinking of a masterpiece to rival Matisse's  great work, but in his own, unique style.In 1907, he begins to create this counter-masterpiece, based on the image of a whorehouse, which is larger than life and full of demonic figures.If Matisse's painting was the Joy of Life, Picasso's might be call The Horror of Sex.

​	He gets his patrons , the Steins, to buy another studio in his apartment in the Bateau Lavoir and sets down to recreate art from the ground up. Picasso is famous for the repidity with which he painted, but he labored over this work for months, filling notebook on primitive sources like Iberian art, which he was very influenced by. Later, he visits the ethnograohic museum in Paris, where he sees African and New Hebrides sculptures, and Native American workds, and is blown away by this completely different approach to form , which is much more conceptual. It is not based on trying to recreate the world that we see, but a symbolic, almost shamanistic approach to the human form.

​	What he creates after eight agonizing months of struggle is a completely new pictoral form . If you stand in front of Les Demoiselles 'd Avignon, the impact is incredible it's enormously in your face. He pressed everything up to the front of the canvas. There is no empty space, just jagged forms, these horrifying creatures who stare right back at you, the viewer. It creates a completely different way of relating to a  painting than the traditional notion of a painting as a window on the world. It's as if the window had been turned inside out, pressing outward into outer space.

# 10  Undersung National Parks

> America's most popular park deserve all the love they get, but here are ten other fascinating sites well worth the trip.

​	America's National Park System is composed of more than 450 natural, historical , and cultural areas spread across the United States and its far-flung territories. Though Yellowstone deserves all the attention it gets, here are ten lesser-known park properties that are calling out for a visit.

## SANDY SHELTER

​	A black lava flat on the west coast of Hawaii's Big Island house the beachfront Pu'uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park,an ancient stone-walled safe place endowed with the power of past Hawaiian chiefs. Be sure to greet the scowling wooden kii statues before entering the site, which also encompasses a former royal compound with thatched temples fish ponds, and tracks used for he's holua , the ancient extreme sport of lava sledding.

## THE RIGHT PATH 

​	More than a home base for migratory birds, the marshy expanse of the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge on Maryland's Eastern Shore provided food and cover to 19th-century slaves as they fled north. Today, pats of the refuge, along with a patchwork of neighboring federal and state lands, make up the abolitionist who escaped bondage on a nearby plantation and went on to help hundreds of freedom.

## REMOTE RETREAT

​	Thanks to unpredicatable winds and coordinates smack in the middle  of the roadless Alaska Peninsula, the Aniakchak National Monument and Preserve is one of America's least-visited national parks -134 people stopped by in 2013, a boom compared to the 19 recorded visitors the previous year. Weather willng, the six-mile-wide, 2500-foot-deep caldera is reachable by power boat or charter seaplane ,but the trek is work it for the tourist-free hiking, rafting , and volcanic vistas.

## MEMORIAL TRAIL MIX

​	Washington ,DC is crammed with memorials: Marble statues of historical VIPs rule over reflecting pools, dominate park squares, and rise up on rearing horses from traffic circles. But America's 26th president pleasantly  proves that some men really are islands-foliage-filled Theodore Roosevelt Island is  a small sancturary in the Potomac River that Frederick Law Olmsted Jr.trans formed from overgrown farmland into a fitting national Central Park, transformed from overgrown farmland into a fitting national memorial to  a leader who was known to drag goverment officials on nature hikes.

## ASTRONAUT PLAYGROUND

​	With bizarre features like cavities in the earth left by lava-incinerated trees, central Idaho's  Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve is indeed a weird and scenic landscape peculiar to itself, as President Calvin Coolidge christened it in 1924. Forty-five years later, the vast lava field—created by several periods of eruptions , the most recent a mere 2000 years ago— hosted the crew of Apollo 14 for a primer on volcanic geology to prep for their trip to the ultimate otherworldly landscape: the moon.

## HOME OF THE BRAVE

# First Bat Removed From US Endangered Species List

> Just thirty years ago, only a thousand of the bats remainded—but after decades of work, the species is thriving.

​	In a conservation first made possible by volunteers, scientists, and a splash of tequila, the long—nosed bat is no longer endangered—the first US bat species to officially recover from the imminedt threat of extinction.

​	The science clearly shows threats to the bat have been eliminated or reduced to the point that the bat has recovered, said Amy Lueders, the southwest regional director for the US Fish and Wildlife Service , in a statement. The Service is proud of our strong, decades-long partnerships with very diverse stakeholders on behalf of the lesser long-nosed bat. Without partnerships and collaborations such as these, successful recovery would not be possible.

​	The lesser long-nosed bat is one of three bat species in the United States that feeds on nectar. One of the Species's major subpopulations migrates between the United States and Mexico. They mate and wait out the winter in southern and central Mexico, roosting together by the thousands to keep warm. In the spring, they migrate north to northern Mexico and southern Arizona, giving birth in many-female maternity caves.

​	The bats colonize a string of caves and abandoned mines along an agave-rich nectar trail from southern Mexico to Arizona. For decades, these roosts—and the bats within them —were under serious threat.

​	According to the US Fish and Wildlife Service , druy and human traffickers operating on the US—Mexico border regularly made use of the caves,disturbing the bats and sometimes killing them outright. Recreational cavers also spooked the bats, and vandals harassed them.

​	What's more , Mexico'efforts to control vampire bats—which can transmit rabies —had too often spilled over into killing other bat species. And the bats' favorite foods, the pollen and nectar from agave plants and cacti, were getting harder and harder to find.

​	These various indignities took their toll. When the species was declared endangered in 1988, the US Fish and Wildlife Service estimated that the bats were down to fewer than a thousand individuals, strewn across only 14 known roots in the US and Mexico.

## BINATINAL BATS

​	For the last three decades , however, the US and Mexico have cooperated to bring the lesser long—nosed bat back from the brink . Now , the US Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that there are some 20000 bats living in at least 75 roosts between the two countries.

​	This is a great example of binational conservation collaboration—of people working on both sides of the border to not just monitor but also take actions to protect this species , says National Geographic explorer Winifred Frick, the chief scientist for Bat Convervation International.

​	Government agencies in the US and Mexico worked to protect agaves and other food sources, such as saguaros. Conservation groups built bat gates that prevented humans from entering caves and abandoned mines that the bats had made their home. And volunteers across southern Arizona regularly called in whenever the bats fed on their hummingdird feeders , giving scientists regular updates on the animals' range.

​	In 2007, the US Fish and Wildlife Service recommended ralabeling the lesser long-nosed bat from endangered to threatened. In 2008, the International Union for the Convervation of Nature made a similar move, upgrading the species from Vulnerable to Near Threatened status. And by 2015, Mexico removed the bat from its endangered species list.

​	In January 2017, the US first announced its intent to follow suit, a decision finalized on April 17, Bat Appreciation Day. Officials have drafted a plan to monitor the bat species, to the sure that its recovery sticks—an effort buoged by Mexico's tequila producers.

# 48 Environmental Victories Since the First Earth Day

> As Earth Day turns 46 , we take a look back at the biggest milestones in environmental protection.

​	The first Earth Day, on April 22,1970, was a milestone event for the planet. An estimated 20 million people took to the streets across the US to raise awareness about the impacts of human activites on the environmental.

​	Since then, the annual tradition has grown to involve billions of people around the world. This year, Earth Day turns 48. To mark this anniversary and to show how much has changed since 1970, we assembled 48 of the most significant accomplishments of the enviromental movement since the first Earth Day.

## 1970 Environmental Magna Carta

​	The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 went into effect the following year, becoming a landmark law that requires every major decision of the federal government to be evaluated for its impact on the evironmental. This began the era of requiring environmental impact statements for building dams, roads, and other major projects.It has been called the environmental Magna Carta for its wide impact and for precedent it set in government , both in the US and abroad.

## 1972 Notorious Toxic Chemical Banned

​	DDT is a colorless, nearly odorless insecticede that was widley used in the post-war era to increase farm productivity and fight mosquitoes.Although a Nobel Prize was awarded for its discovery, scientists eventually realized that DDT was causing problems in the environment, including thinning the shells of birds's eggs. Rachel Carson popularized this research in the 1962 book Silent Spring .After DDT was banned, bald eagles, peregrine falcons and many other endangerd bird species returned from the brink of extinction.

## 1972 Regulating Pesticides

​	In 1972, the Federal Environmental Pesticde Control Act was passed, updating a 1910 law that had required truth in advertising for pesticdes. The new law charged regulators with considering the impacts of pestcides on human and environmental Protection Agency was given more teeth to police the market and restrict and outlaw toxic chemicals.

## 1972 Cleaning Up Rivers

​	In 1972, the Clean Water Act passed, with the goal of making all rivers in the country swimmable and fishable again.In just a few years, the  resulting efforts to restrict pollution led to rivers that no longer burst into flames.

## 1972 Marine Sanctuaries Created

​	Although goverments had been protecting land as wilderness areas for more than a century , the idea took longer to catch on for the ocean. In  1972, the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act started the country's system of marine sanctuaries. These special places now protect preceless biological, historical, and cultural treasures, from the reefs of the Florida Keys to shipwrecks in the Great Lakes. The sanctuaries also become a boon to the tourism industry.

## 1972 Saving Whales

​	Whales, dolphins, seals and manatees received strict protection from hunting and harassment in US waters with the eMarine Mammal Protection Act. As a result , their numbers began to slowly in the ensuing decades.A robust eco-tourism bussiness followed in their wake.

## 1973 Saving Species

​	The landmark Endangerd Species Act resulted in substantial protections for listed plants and animals, including bans on harvesting and a framework that protects critical habitat. In some cases, captive breeding and reintroduction programs began in an effort to reverse decades of population decines caused by human activites. Species that showd significant recovery as a result range from the toothy American crocodile to the plucky Delmarva fox squirrel.

## 1975 Global Agreement on Endangered Species

​	The Convention on Internatinal Trade in Endangered Species was drafted for signatures in 1973 and went into effect in 1975. Signatory countries agree to ban or restrict trade in endangered  species and their body parts. Although black markets arose for such products as tiger skin and elephant tusks, countries have also  worked together to combat such trafficking.

# How to Create a Music Score for Our Planet

> Following a premiere on Earth Day, this imersive composition will take off with an orchestral tour.

​	What instrument characterizes a herd of running bison? What sound would  you use  to illustrate a feeding hummingbird?

​	On April 22, Net Geo WILD will air Symphony for Our World, a one-hour orchestral celebration of our little blue planet. The immersive multimedia piece pairs natural history footage from National Geogaphic's archives with the symphonic stylings of Bleeding Finders Music in collaboration with X Ambassadors, the American rock band famous for the songs Unsteady and Renegades.

​	In addition to the televised Earth Day event, Symphony will kick off the tour of a 90-minute live orchestral performance. The first showing will be held at San Francisco's Louise M Davies Symphony Hall on April 22, and more than 50 other performance across Mexico, the US and Canada will follow .Photos from the National Geographic Photo Ark will also be featured during this event.

## HOW TO SCORE NATURE

​	The symphony covers five movements , starting with seas progressing through shore, land, mountains, and sky biomes. Austin Fray scored the overture, in addition to the sea, land and sky movements, while Andrew Christie took on the movements for shore and mountains.

​	Anytime it's huge and epic, me and Andrew both love that, Fray , who has worked on films like Star Trek Beyond and The Hobbit. I try to put a lot of excellence into everything I write.

​	The composition starts off with sweeping shots of the ocean backed by swelling woodwind and string melodies. The crashing of waves emerge as the rest of the symphony joins in, and the setting eventually dips under the surface to capture marine life, from plankton , octopuses, and coral to sea turtles and countless species of fish.

​	The melody alternates within each movement depending on the footage.In Shore, the tone goes eerie with creeping prey and tense with predator attacks. In Land, jumping beats set the soundtrack for playful baby animals and epic swells narrate intense animal battles. The sounds of nature hover throughout the symphony, whether in the form of croaking frogs or howling wolves.

​	Fray says Seas was his favorite because of his background . His family lived on a sailboat for two years when he was growing up.

​	It took me back home,took me back to my family, Fray says. It was just something that I really connected with.

​	For this movement, Fray dissected the sea ecosystem to see what set it apart sonically from the other environments. He heard a hardness in the coral reefs and molusks that he translated into percussive marimaba and xylophone sounds. For later movements, his mind went to piccolos for hummingbirds and  percussion for animal herds. Fray's eclectic musical tastes give his sound a simultaneously detailed and vast tone.

​	In contrast , Christie's movements are more layered and weighty. The LA-based Australian composer, whose resume includes Rush and Girl Rising, interpreted the footage more abstractly.

​	It's hard to intellectualize it. It was more just, for me, watching the picture and intuitively reaching to it, Christie says. The Australian aesthetic is open wide space, it comes out of my music quite a bit.

​	In collaboration with the Bleeding Fingers composers, the sounds of X Ambassadors make an appearance in the score. Singer Sam Nelson Harris' wailing vocals accompany piano riffs and drum elements, offering a lyric-less accompaniment to the classical music. Fray says the vocals brought in a raw human element that couldn't be made with instruments. The lack of lyrics freed the composers to experiment with their creative liberties.

​	There's no dialogue to hide under, Christie says. It's educational in a different way narration.

## INSPIRING CHANGE

​	Tuiumphant melodies and musical bursts make the composition downright inspiring and Fray and Christie hope that Symphony for Our World will move people to care more about our world.

​	If people aren't aware or not making  that emotional connection with different parts of the planet , it's harder to not care about environmental conservation, Fray says. Any program like this  has a lot of wieght and importance as things get harder and harder on the  environment. We need to keep making these documentaries to keep the conversation going.

## THE MOST COMPELLING PHOTOS OF EARTH

# Here Are Some Alternatives to Reef-Damagin Sunscreen

> Harmful chemicals from suncreen can leach into the ocean damage coral. Here are some sun-blocking alternatives.

​	From a distance, Australia's Great Barrier Reef is an underwater gem. The reef's colorful corals serve as a submerged garden for a vibrant marine ecosystem that draws visitors to the area from all over the world. Snorkelers and scuba-divers alike can swim alongside some of the thousands of species of fish that make the reef their home. Lucky travelers might even catch a glimpse of the ecosytem's dugongs or sea turtles.

​	But the ecosystem is fragile. Rising temperatures and harmful chemicals leaching into the water are bleaching the once-thriving reef. Human visitors might even be carrying some of these toxins on their skin.

​	When you siwm sunscreen on, chemicals like oxybenzone can seep into the water, where they're absorbed by corals . These substance can disrupt coral's reproduction and growth cycles, ultimately leading to bleaching. Even if you don't go swimming after applying sunscreen, it can still go down drains when you shower. Aerosol can often spray large amounts of sunscreen onto sand, where it gets washed into our oceans.

​	Human might be responsible for this contamination, but we're also capable of helping heal these fragile underwater ecosystems. 

## AT-RISK REEFS

​	Coral reefs all over the world are threatened by pollution, and many of the most popular destincation spots have the most at-risk coral.In addiiton to the Great Barrier Reef, heavy human traffic in the bays of Hawaii, the US Virgin Islands, and Israel are especially vulnerable.

​	Oahu'a Hanauma Bay, a state park that was formed within a volcanic cone, is one such example . The area's turquoise surf and vibrant coral gardens draw nearly 1 million tourists each year, making the spot one of Hawaii's best places for snorkeling. The bay is home to 450 species of fish and has the largest mass of reef anywhere in Oaha.

​	Hurricane Hole at the Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument, located off Saint John, is another popular spot.The submersed monument protects 22 miles of marine habitat, including 30 out of the 45 known coral species. Here, visitors can snorkel in the mangroves with coral ,fish, and marine invertebrates.

​	Israel's popular Eilate Coral Beach Nature Reserve is another example. The Gulf of Eilat houses the country's only coral reefs, which are a major draw for tourists.Bridges built over top of the reefs allow visitors to get a peek at the coral and colorful fish it houses. Scuba divers can also dive along the front and slope of the reef for a more intimate view.

​	If we lose reefs, we will have lost a vital ecostytem. We could also hurt our global economy-coral reefs are a major torist attraction and source of income for these economy— coral reefs are a major tourist attraction and source of income for these popular vacation spots

## STEPS FOR REEF SAFETY

​	Hawaii has taken steps to ban sunscreen that's not safe for coral, and lawmakers will vote on it at the end of the month. The bill could go into effect by July 2019.

​	But governments don't want people to stop using sunscreen all together , due to risks of burns and skin cancer. The good news is there are alternatives that are safer—for people and for coral —that don't include oxybenzone.

​	Haereticus Environmental Lab publishes a list each year of what suncreens are safe for the environment, and organizations like the Environmental Working Group also publish a safe suncreen guide. Mineral-based sunblocks that use titanium dioxide and zinc oxide are safer than the oxybenzone—containing alternatives. Sunscreens with non-nano size particles are safer because they can't be ingested by corals. Some sunscreens have a combination of nano-size and non-nano size particles, and the Consumer Products Inventory has a database that can tell you if yor sunscreen contains nanoparticles.

​	Some tour companies in popular destinations like Mexico make it mandatory for visitors to wear only biodegradable sunscreen . Select Hawaiian resorts give out free reef-safe sunscreen samples that don't contain harmful chemicals. Many of these resorts will let patrons know of these restrictions in advance or list it on their websites.

​	Dermatologists say clothing is just as effective as sunscreen at protecting from the sun, with the only downside being it doesn't completely cover the body.Many compaines offer sun-protecting clothing , such as  long—sleeve rash guards or full-body swimsuits. When all else fails, put on a t-shirt.

# How You Can Participate in Earth Day

> From grassroots to global, these initiatives aim to counter our most pressing environmental issues.

​	Need some motivation to get into the Earth Day spirit? Try turning on Nat Geo WILD's Spotify playlist.

​	If that still hasn't done it for you, try watching scenes from National Geographic's show One Stragnge Rock. It's told through the perspective of the only people who have gotten an outside view of Earth, astronauts, and each episode unpacks an Earthly wonder.

​	Clearly we here at National Geographic embrace Earth Day, and we're celebrating the day in a big way. But there are a lot of ways you can participate beyond our yellow border.

​	Since the first Earth Day in 1970, the day has become an international focus for action. Environmental group Earth Day Network estimates that as many as one billion people around the world celebrate Earth Day in some way. Unsure how you can get in on the action? Below are just some of the few ways you can participate.

## Ditch Your Plastic

​	This year, Earth Day Network is putting the spotlight on plastic pollution. Plastic is pervasive , and it's more than a water bottle or two thrown on the sidewalk. The garbage patch the size of Texas meandering through the Pacific?It's made of 1.8 million tons of plastic and about 94 percent of that is micro plastic. Those bit-sized pieces of plastic are found throughout the ocean, and can even end up on your plate.

​	The Earth Day Network has  created a toolkit that helps you calculate your plastic use and create a plan to cut down on consumption.

​	You can start with easy steps like ditching your straw.

## Plant a Tree

​	Trees play an important role in balancing our ecosystem by absorbing carbon. They can even help reduce the impacts of climate change by pulling greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.

​	The organization One Tree Planted organizes meet-ups for people to plant trees together , but if you don't see region represented, you can easily sign up to stage your own event . Earth Day Network also organizes tree-planting groups in urban areas and schools or allows you to donate.

## Go Local

​	Local communities are at the front lines of keeping their towns green. Online platforms like Eventbrite and Facebook can help you find Earth Day events in your own town. Many cities hold gatherings like festivals, marches , talks ,or concerts to help stoke that Earth Day server.

​	And , of course, you can always let your representatives in Congress congress know where your priorities are by writing to them.

## Celebrate Through Song

​	How do you write a classical music score for the Earth? These composers tackled the challenge for National Geographic's Symphony for our World event.

​	Symphony for Our World pairs stunning natural images with a symphonic composition by Bleeding Fingers Music . On Earth Day the Net Geo WILD channel will air an hour-long special at 7 pm EST 6pm CST Images will come from National Geographic an Joel Sartore's Photo Ark, a project to photographically document key animal species.

​	After April 22 the symphony will then go on tour in the US. Canada,Australia, and Mexico, A full schedule and tickets can be found here.

# They Journeyed Into One of the Last Great Wildernesses. Here's How It Changed Them.

> A multinational team  of conservations spent a grueling , transcendent four months on a 1500-mile expedition to save the Okavango Delta—but the mission's just beginning

​	In northwestern Botswana, the arid ground of the Kalahari Desert gives way beneath the thousand green fingers — an unfurling hand of permanent marshes and seasonal floodplains, knuckled with islands, whorled by shifting channels and streams- known as the Okavango Delata.

​	The inland terminus of  a massive wetland that traces its sources north through the Namibian panhandle to rivers in the Angolan highlands, it's Africa's largest intact watershed. It's a UNESCO World Heritage Site, giving shelter to thousands of unique species of flora and fauna and sustenance to a million people , including indigenous  groups whose communites line the rivers and dot the delta. When winter floodwaters reach Botswana, the 8500-square-mile plain is visible from space.

​	For some, it's become the center of the world.

​	You feel like you've been  looking for something your whole life, says Steve Boyes, a conservation biologist and National Geographic Fellow who has made the delta his life's work. And then you find it.

​	The first time he saw the Okavango Delta, at 31 years old in 2000, the South African quit his job and told his university supervisor, I'll try to finish my master's degree from Botswana, but i'm going . Bye.

​	It was the start of a calling that would eventually lead Boyes—and a team of equally zealous conservations—to undertake an expedition that, by their own estimation, was slightly insane: to survery the entire system, from beginning to end, in a whole—hearted  attempt to learn anything and everything they could use to protect it.

## SOURCE TO SAND

​	Over a decade of fieldwork(during which he did, in fact, finish his master's , as well as a PHD) Boyes came to realize the only way to preserve the Okavango is to preserve all of it, headwaters to endpoint.

​	A patchwork of game resrves and other managed areas protect the system's Botswanan swath. But the delta's richness obscures its dependence on water management in Namibia, where agricultural irrigation schemes divert and pollute the tributary Cubango River—and in Angola,  where a brutal 27-year-civil war and its lingering consequences have divorced the southeastern highlands from the rest of the nation, leaving the delta's vulnerable headwaters to a management vacuum.

​	Boyes, along with the Naitonal Geographic Okavango Wilderness Project he directs, envisions a protected area that spans the entire Okavango Basin and its three constiuent countires. But data comes before policy , and they needed data. So in May of 2015, Boyes and a team of scientists and guides set out with literal tons of gear to canoe a 1500-mile path from the origin of the Cuito River through that tributary's course to meet the Cubango River , transecting the delta to end at the salt flats marking the  delta's southern edge. 

# Breakthroughs From the Far Corners of Science

> Eye clips, no-melt ice cream , and an ancient skull-cracking weapon.

## CLIPPED VISION

​	For a number of vision problems, the artificial intraocular lens above may be the solution . Also called an iris clip, the ultra thin lens is attached to the eye's iris using a tiny incision. This eye belongs to a 70-year-old man; after a cataract surgery failed, the IOL restored his vision almost fully.

## NO-MELT ICE CREAM

​	Scientists have found a solution to sticky ice-cream hands-entirely by accident .After the 2011 tsunami damaged Japanese strawberry fields, the fruit was too unsightly to be sold whole. Pharmacy professor Tomihisa Ohta and his team at Kanazawa Univertsity thought they had a solution: They would make an extract from the strawberries-liquid polyphenol-that could be used as a new dessert topping. When they added polyphenol to cream, though , it solidified instantly,making it useless as a topping —but perfect as a binding agent. They'd inadvertently created a frozen dessert that doesn't melt.Kanazawa ice-cream pops, which stay frozen for an hour at room temperature, are now sold throughout Japan.

## STONE AGE SLUGGER

​	The Thames beater, a fourth-millennius BC wooden club unearthed in London looks like it could crack a human skull. Archaeologists at Edinburgh University wanted to make sure. They acquired a fake human skull made of bonelike polyurethane, rubber skin , and gelatin to mimic human tissue.Then they smashed it with a replica wooden club The result:The they smashed it with a replica wooden club .The result:The fractures on the fake skull matched those on a Neolithic skull found in Austria. It was the first time a blunt- force Stone Age weapon has been identified in Europe. If we understand the violence of a time period, we can start to understand social interactions, says Meaghan Dyer, author of the 2017study to understand social interactions, says Meaghan Dyer, author of the 2017study in the journal Antiquity. Her next test: beatings with ancient ancient tools made of antler and stone

## LIMPETS TO THE RESCUE

​	A hungry algae-eater can protect an entire ecosystem from the effects of climate change, a study finds. Limpets-aquatic mollusks that graze on algae—kept microalgae from overtaking a rocky intertidal ecosystem and erasing its diversity.If important consumers like these are lost, the ecosystem is more likely to be harmed by a warming climate, says lead researcher Rebecca Kordas of the University of British Columbia

# How We've Tackled the Evolving Science of DNA

> No article we have ever published has been more diffcult than our first feature about the molecule of life, which appeared 42 years ago.

​	On April 25,1953, the journal Nature published a picture that sparked a revolution: the first drawing of the structure of the DNA molecule . That landmark discovery, made possible by the x-ray crystallography work of Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, put Francis Crick and James Watson at the forefront of the burgeoning field of molecular biology.

​	Within weeks , the New York Times proclaimed that discovery should make biochemical history, and in the years since, news outlets have published reams about DNA and its importance to unraveling the way life works.

​	But for its part, National Geographic didn't make the plunge into molecular biology until 23 years after the discovery of the double helix.

​	For a magazin that had long prided itself on place-driven narratives and photography, grappling with the microscopic world of the new biology pushed National Geographic staff at the time to the point of discomfort. It took the magazine more than two years to assemble its first foray into molecular biology,a splashy feature titled The Awesome Worlds Within a Cell that ran in the September 1976 issue.

​	Rereading the story today, the relieved sign the staff must have made as the story went to press is almost palpable.

​	No article we have ever published has been more diffcult ,either in the amount of effort and skill that went into its preparation, or in the perseverance readers must bring to it if they are to understand this complex new  face of science, Gil Grosvenor , then National Geographic's editor-in-chief,wrote in an accompanying letter to readers.

## A SOLID BASE

​	In a sense, the story helped mark National Geographic's transition to an institution that increasingly tackled the complexities of science in all forms including an  ongoing exploration of the wonders and challenges of unlocking DNA . The molecule makes a guest appearance, for instance, in a 1977 story about new microscope technologies . And in December 1984, geneticist Robert Weaver—the son of longtime National Geographic editor Kenneth Weaver penned a feature about the then-nascent field of biotechnology, kicking off decades of coverage involving this rapidly advancing science.

​	As readers learned , the increasingly versatiel DNA toolkit could trace the origins of elephant ivory, identify ancient diseases in long-dead mummies, help unravel the mysteries of aging, and even chart life's story back to its very origins. The double helix was also being employed to study endangerd species and act as a fingerprinting technique for identifying each individual on the planet.

​	As the coverage progressed , so too did readers'familiarity with the language of genetics.

​	You started hoping for the day when you didn't have to take a paragraph to say, This is the stuff of the double helix, and this is how traits are inherited, says Jamie Shreeve, a National Geographic contributing editor and former executive editor for science. My career spanned the time from when you always had to do that to when you almost never had to do that.That's a cool thing.

​	Shreeve is arguably one of National Geographic's most influential genetic chroniclers. As a freelance journalist, he wrote a sweeping 1999 feature about the race to decode the human genome, following it up in 2006 with a story on our greatest journey: the genetic trails Homo sapiens have ventured on across millennia. Shreeve and others reinvented how to describe DNA to nonspecialist audiences—trying to push beyond the blueprint metaphors so often used before.

​	The genome is really like a piano keyboard: Each key plays a note, and that note is a protein that gene is expressing, says Shreeve. What matters is how these genes are combined into different chords and scales and melodies and harmonies that create the processes of all life. There's jazz frogs and classical snakes and country-music dinosaurs-there's just one kind of heredity molecule, but it does so many different things.

​	However, more than two-thirds of  the magazine's mentions of DNA occur after 2003 , which saw the publication of the first full sequence of the human  genome as part of the US National Institutes of Health's Human Genome Project.

​	With this powerful tool for undrstanding our own genetic code, DNA could provide clues to the identity of the Phoenicians, and could allow scientists to peer deeper into  the lives of the powerful Medici family , whose remains were exhumed in 2004.The magazine also made clear that the genetic revolution provided further backing in the overwhelming case for evolution. We've come a long way since Darwin looked for evidence in his pigeon coop, the writer drolly notes.

# Alleged Golden State Killer Busted by DNA But Are Tests 100% Accurate?

> An alleged serial killer has been charged by police in California for crimes reported decades ago. Here's what the science can and can't tell us.

​	Advanced DNA testing reportedly provided police with a breakthrough in the infamous Golden State Killer case. Joseph James DeAngelo, 72,was arrested Wednesday by the Sacramento Sheriff on charges of murder. Police link the alleged Golden State Killer to 12 homicides 45 rapes, and 120 home invasions in the 1970s and 80s in California.

​	Although police say they have a range of evidence in the case, they are touting the strength of what they claim is a 100% DNA match to samples taken from crime scenes decades ago. In response to  social buzz around the case, we wanted to expore the concept of a 100% DNA match . What certainty can DNA testing bring to a case?

​	Short answer: Not really 100%. The longer answer:While DNA is extremely good at identifying individuals,mistakes have happened. Accurate identification is dependent on a number of factors, including the quality of the DNA sample, the number of genetic markers analyzed, whether the sample was prepared properly , and the ability of those doing the analysis to interpret the results.

​	A DNA match identifies the potential source of the DNA, but it says nothing about the activity involved in the DNA coming to be where it was found Sue Pope, a DNA expert,told The Guardian.

​	DNA is found in every cell in our bodies, from heart to skin, blood to bone. It contains genetic information that helps determine physical characteristics such as eye color. DNA is made up of billions of letters of the genetic code and, amazingly,99.9 percent of that code is exactly the same in every human. The 0.1 percent of the code that's different in each of us is what make us geneticaly unique.

​	DNA testing uses a dozen or more genetic markers in the code to identify the important similarities or differences between people. The more markers used, the greater the accuracy, but also the cost of testing. The probability of the DNA profiles of two unrelated individuals matching is on average less than 1 in 1 billion.

​	A sample can be from any part of the body, since the DNA is the same. In the lab, the DNA is separated and million or PCR . These DNA copies are cut into chunks at specific locations to make them easier to analyze and thus create a DNA fingerprint. The result is then compared to the DNA fingerprint from another sample to see if they match.

​	Even advanced DNA testing , which allow the recovery of  minute traces of DNA , cannot prove how the DNA got to a crime scene. We are constantly shedding skin cells or leaving traces on door handles, on money, or even by shaking a hand. DNA can hang around in a room for months or blow out the window and be taken miles away.

​	You could detect a single cell on a knife blade, but that doesn't mean anything it might have arrived there long before the crime or been transferred there by chance, John Butler, special assistant to the director for forensic science at the National Institute of Standards and Technology told Frontline.

​	In the case of the alleged Golden State Killer, as  in all other cases, it is up to the prosecution to present a coherent argument that convinces a judge and jury of a defendant's guilt. Juries are asked to weigh the sum of evidence in each case, and to interpret the facts as best they can  within the confines of the law. It's not an easy job. DNA evidence can provide valuable information—though there are some limitations.

# Explore an Abandoned Chinese Fishing Village

> Once a prominent fishing village, Houtouwan,china , now attracts adventurous exporers craving some green.

​	About 40 miles southeast of Shanghai , the small island of Shengshan rises up out of the East China Sea. There ,the former fishing village of Houtouwan is carpeted with lush, overgrown greenery , a foliage-rich shadow of what it used to be.

​	In the 1990s, the town was home to about 2000 fishermen and their families. People were prosperous in Houtouwan for a time, but over the years the fishing community couldn't keep up with growing competition in nearby Shanghai. So, the fish-dependent polulation eventually migrated to mainland China for better prospects. Over the next few decades, the houses fell into disuse and local plants invaded.

​	Dozens of modern houses that have been overwhelmed by nature dot the hillside right up to the sea. Some of their walls have fallen or their roofs have collapsed, while others have had their industrial finish replaced with blankets of local vince and grasses. Snaking dirt roads connect the abandoned houses and the remains of a fishing port hint at the village's commercial past. If you peek into some former homes,you can see decaying household objects and decrepit pieces of forgotten furniture.

​	Less than a dozen people still live in Houtouwan today. But instead of profiting from fishing, they've turned to something else. Locals now tour a handful of day trippers though the once-thriving village and sell them water, which is the only  object for sale in the village. 

​	Last year, Shanghai-based bideographer Joe Nafis visted the area to document it with another photographer. Although it normally takes five or six hours , it took the pair nearly 36 hours to reach the village from the mainland since they couldn't find the right ferries or connections to other local towns. Once he got to the ruined town, Nafis explored from ground level and from a bird's eye view with his drone.

​	Using the drone to explore the village first was a good idea as the paths were not well maintained and overgrown, Nafis tells Colossal. Some of the buildings were in  tatters, while others looked  like they were going through a remedel. It was all very strange.

​	From Shanghai ,you can to the Nanpu Bridge Bus Station and take a bus and ferry ride to Shengshan Island or to Gouqi Island, which is connected ot Shengshan via bridge. That commute alone takes about four hours. From there, you can take a taxi to Houtouwan and hike through the village and the  surroundng area. When you see a big temple, you're getting close.

​	Vendors on the islands sell fresh seafood. Since Houtouwan is nearby abandoned ,you can't stay there, but accommodations are available in nearby villages.

# The Dangers of Dzud, Mongolia's Lethal Winters

​	For the second time this decade, extreme winter conditions on the Mongolian steppe caused extensive die-offs of sheep, goats, cattle, and camels, animals that traditional herding communities rely on for their survival.

​	Due to an ongoing drought, the nomad's livestock faced a lack of adequate forage in the grasslands along the country's northern border with Russia, and they went into year's winter season much thinner than usual. If a bad winter follows a learn summer, livestock can burn through their fat reserves faster, and herders must turn to their hay reserves months earlier than usual.

​	This past January, temperatures on the steppe plunged to -58 degrees Fahredheit —more than 10 degrees below average—and 70000 animals perished as a result.

​	Severe winters that kill large numbers of livestock are common enough in Mongolia that there is  a local term for the phenomenon: dud.now, the consensus among the nomads is that dzud has been occurring more frequently in recent years, and it seems to be getting worse.

​	Patrck Nicholson, director of communications for the Catholic aid group Caritas, spent part of January speaking with people in Mongolia's Uvs province about this year's dud. He says that a local governor, who goes only by the name Batjargal, believes overgrazing and changing climate are exacerbating the problem.

​	We used to have four seasons,but now we only have three, Batjargal told Nicholson. Before ,June July, and Augst were warm and with rain . Different types of grass would grow, and the animals would get fat. Now , we have no rain and the wind dries up the grass.It is not what it used to be.

​	This is a threat not to livestock, but to the nomads' way of life: Bereft of the animals they rely on for food and income, hundreds of thousands of herders have streamed into the country's capital of Ulaanbaatar, hoping to send their children to school and find work.

​	Finding solutions is complicated by the fact that dzud is difficult to predict, since the conditions that give rise to the disaster are hard to pin down, says University of Maine climate researcher Bradfield Lyon.

​	There's not just one pattern we can identify and say, Ah! This will lead to problems, he says. Even with  long-range weather prediction models, it's difficult to capture how long these things are going to persist. There's so much variability in  atmospheric patterns.

# Why Your Dog Freaks  Out During Thunderstorme—And What to Do

> With summer around the corner, we looked into what causes storm anxiety, and how to soothe our canines.

​	Summer weather is just around the  corner—and with it thunderstorms that may freak out your dog. We looked into what causes this anxiety, and how to soothe their rainy-day feelings.

​	Signs of anxiousness is dogs are ears back, tails down, eyes wide, panting, lip-licking and yawning, say Terry Curtis, a clinical behaviorist at the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine.

​	Sometimes, their panic escalates to dangerous levels during thunderstorms . I've had cases where the dog has dug through walls, all the way through the drywall, Curtis says. Another dog jumped through a sliding glass door.

## ELECTRIFIED

​	Diopping barometric pressure—which dogs can sense—coupled with darking skies, wind, and the sheer noise of thunder can cause fearful reactions in dogs. 

​	Some dogs have canine noise aversion, which can make them uncomfortable or even phobic about loud sounds.

​	Static buildup in their fur is another likely explanation, says Nicholas Dodman, a veterinary behaviorist at Tufts University and chief scientific officer at the Center for Canine Behavior Studies.

​	Large dogs and those with long or double coats easily build up static electricity, the way we do when we wear a sweater and get a shock from the car door if we're not wearing rubber-soled shoes, he says.

​	A dog already nervous  during storms may get another shock when touching its nose to a metal object. Then mild discomfort could escalate to full-on phobia Dodman says.

​	Kelly Ballyntyne, clinical assistant professor at the University of Illionsi College of Veterinary Medicine, says that it's  difficult to test whether static buildup causes anxiety in dogs.

​	Our canines incredible noses may just be smelling changes in the environment that predict a storm is coming, she says.

​	In addition, there's a little bit of evidence that there can be some genetic  predispositions for animals to develop noise phobia, such as border collies and Australian shepherds.

## SOOTHING THE STORM-WEARY PUP

​	While treating storm-phobic dogs, Dodman noticed that many canines seek out  hiding places grounded against electric shocks, such as bathtubs, jacuzzis,or behind the toilet tank.

​	Curious about this odd behavior, he started informally asking owners where their dogs hide, and half of them said the bathroom. One 80-pound German shepherd even jumps into the sink , he says.

​	Curtis and Dodman both recommend owners buy a anti-static jacket to keep the dog calm, and Dodman adds that rubbing them down with an anti-static dryer sheet also helps. Sung-fitting wraps can also be comforting.

​	Ballyntyne suggests dog owners videotape their dog while away to look for signs such  as pacing , panting, and restlessness. These behaviors could reveal mild separation anxiety that 's exacerbated by  storms.

​	She also advises letting the animal decide where it feels safe, and then making that area more comfortable by adding while-noise machines-to buffer the noise of thunder—or acoustic tiling for soundproofing.

​	And all the experts agreed that a veterinarian can prescribe medication if needed.

​	If the dog is panicked, Ballantyne says, anti-anxiety medication will go a long way to improve that dog's quality of life.

# Meet the Man Who Knew Cecil the Lion Best

> Andrew Loveridge tracked Cecil for years before the lion was killed. He talks about his love for Cecil-and the plight of African lions.

​	When he was shot by American trophy hunter Walter Palmer in 2015, Cecil the lion became an instant media sensation, his death mourned around the globe by millions, the man killed him branded a monster and eventually forced into hiding. It was , above all, the fact that Cecil was left to die a long, slow ,agonizing death that so incensed the world.

​	In his new book, Lion Hearted, Andrew Loveridge, a research fellow at Oxford Uniersity in England and the man who knew Cecil better than anyone, tells the story of the lion he loved, as well as the wider issues facing these magnificent creatures.

​	Speaking from Oxford, he explains why Walter Palmer was the perfect hate figure; why banning hunting alone will not save African lions; and why Cecil's death was a major turning point for the trophy hunting lobby.

> You were the person who equipped Cecil with a radio collar. Describe that experience and how you felt, seven years later, when you heard he had been shot.

​	I collared him for the first time in 2007. He was a member of a two-male coalition that had moved into our study area.He was an amazing , big lion, but most of them are in that area. He became unique in that he was a long-term study. We studied him for seven years.

​	He lived in the tourists hub of Hwange National Park, so he became very well known to both the research team and to tourists. He became well habituated to vehicles, so you could approach him very closely and people could get fantastic photographs and videos of him.

​	The last time I saw Cecil was about a month and a half before he was killed .We were tracking him from his radio collar and found him sitting on the road. We sat about two meters away  from him, enjoying being that close to a big lion , and he was completely unconcerned .Six weeks later, someone comes along with a bow and arrow and shoots him. It is incredibly distressing when an animal you've got to know for so long is subjected to a very , very painful death.

	## Cecil lived in the Hwange National Park in Zimbabwe. Put us on the ground and explain the kinds of problems lions face there.

​	Hwange is in the far west of Zimbabwe, right on the  Botswana border. It's about  14000 square kilometers , about the size of Northern Ireland. We have about 500 lions living there, so it's quite a stable  population. But around the edges of the park you have local people living a subsistence lifestyle with cattle and growing crops. And you have hunting concessions. They get hunting quotas to shoot lions, elephants, leopards, and other animals.

​	The threats that face lions are, firstly, that they come into contact with people. A lot of livestock is lost to lions every year around Hwange. These are very poor people and they get very irate and often those lions end up being killed. The other threat is trophy hunting  and that is why we set up the project in the first place. There was a lot of concern that the quotas for hunting lions weren't sustainable or realistic and , as it turned out , they weren't. Around Hwange the biggest source of mortality, particularly for male lions, is trophy hunting.

## Trophy hunting got a terrible rap after the death of Cecil. But for the local peopel it is a source of income, isn't it? Paradoxically, it also provides protected areas for lions. Talk us through these tensions.

​	You have to look back to the begining of the 20th century when colonial administrations were allocating lands. They thought, We want to protect wildlife because we like wild animals, mostly because these guys were elite, upper class hunters themselves. That was  the root of conservation in Africa. These areas were set aside for wild animals that would be hunted and that's continued right through.

​	Some of those areas bacame national parks, where no hunting is permitted. But about 1.2 million square kilometers of land in Africa is set aside for hunting. These areas actually do protect wildlife , by protecting  their habitat. Hunting also benefits economies, though not as much as hunters claim. It certainly benefits local Africans very little . A lot of the revenue is skimmed off by political elites.

# Jupiter at Its Best , and More Can't-Miss Sky Events in May

> The solar system's largest planet will take center stage, while a meteor shower and a planet-hopping moon also light up the night.

​	Sky-watchers will get a chance in  the coming weeks to catch a storied meteor shower , gaze at the largest planet shining its brightest, and witness the moon playing hop-scotch with neighboring worlds across the overnight sky.

​	So dust of those binoculars, and turn your gaze toward the heavens this month.

## Venus and Bull's Eye-May 2

​	At dusk , look for the super-bright planet Venus to join the star Aldebaran-the red eye of Taurus , the bull-low in the northwesern sky. The two star-like objects will appear to be separeated by six degrees,equal to about the width of your fist held at arm's length. While both points of light appear similar in brightness, you should easily notice their distinct colors:stark white for Venus and organge-red for Aldebaran.

## Moon, Saturn , and Teapot -May 4

​	Early risers can watch the waning gibbous moon join the ringed planet in the eastern sky about an hour before local sunrise. As an added observing challenge, book for a fainter nake-eye star below the cosmic pair. Lambda Sagittari marks the tip of the Teapot, a pattern of stars known as an asterism.Binoculars may help pinpoint all these stars nestled within the constellation Sagittarisu , the archer.

## Eta Aquarid Meteor Shower-May 5

​	Get set for shooting stars all week long with the arrival of the Eta Aquarid meteor shower, which will peak on the night of May 5 and into the  following morning. Trace the paths of individual meteors, and you will notice that they appear to originate from the eastern part of the sky, where Aquarius , the water bearer, can be seen this time of year.

​	Most of the sky show will be visible from southerly latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere and across the entire Southern Hemisphere. Astronomers are expecting rates of up to 30 meteors an hour streaking through the northest skies starting around 10 pm local time. The best views will be from the dark countryside, away from city light pollution. But you can probably catch a few of the brighter meteors, including a couple of fireballs, sweeping through the upper atmosphere even from a suburban backyard.

​	This meteor shower's claim to fame is that the shooting stars are lefeover pieces of Halley's Comet, which last swung past Earth in 1986. The  famous comet won't be back until 2062, but during the annual Eta Aquarids, we can still see the sand grain-size particles shed by this icy visitor burn up high above our heads.
