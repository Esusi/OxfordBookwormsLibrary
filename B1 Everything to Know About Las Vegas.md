# Dramatic Photos Show How Sand Mining Threatens a Way of Life in Southeast Asia

> In An Giang Province, Vietnam, a half-mile stretch of riverfront along the Van River collapsed in April 2017, plunging houses and part of the road the river. Sand mining had weakened the bank

One afternoon last year, Ha Thi Be 67, was siting with her son in her tiny coffee shop in the town of Hong Ngu, looking out on the lazy Tien River, the main branch of the Mekong in Vietnam, Suddenly, the ground beneath them gave way. The river bank was crumbing into the water. We shouted out loud and ran, she says. It srashed with a huge sound, boom, boom.

Be and her son escaped unharmed, but the  coffee shop and her nearby house were destroyed. It took all of what we owned to build the house, and now it's all gone, she sighes. Still, Be counts herself luncky. If it had happened at night, I and my grand would have died. We used to sleep in that house, she says.

​	The main causes of the collapse can be seen floating in many places on the Tien's murky waters dredging boats , using rackety pumps to raise from the river bed enormous quantities of sand. In recent years,that humble substance has become an stonishingly hot commodity. Sand is a key ingredient in concrete, the essential building material of Vietnam's fast-growing cities. Demand for it is surging  and that is wreaking havoc not only on Vietnam's rivers, but also on the all important Mekong Delta. (Read about the damming of the Mekong in the magazine)

> Left:Ha Thi Be and her two grandsons stand in the ruins of her ancestral home along the Tien River in Dong Thap Province. The goverment warned her to relocate inland to live with her son in January 2017, two months before the house eventually collapsed.But everything I own was in this house, and now everything is gone, she said.

> Right:In July 2017 Ba Tu 72,returned to what's left of her house in Nha Be, a suburb of Ho Chi Minh CIty. Four days earlier, part of the house had fallen into the river. Ba Tu was home with her daughter-in-law when it happened, but both women escaped injury.

In towns and villages all along the Mekong River and many other rivers around the country, banks undermined by dredging are collapsing into the water, taking with them farm fields,fish ponds ,shops and homes. Inrecent years, thousands of acres of rice farms have been lost, and at least 1200 families have had to be relocated. Hundreds more have evacaated in-stream islands that were literally disappearing beneath their feet. Goverment offcials estimate some 50000 people in the Mekong Delta area alone need to be moved out of such landslide zones.

​	River sand mining isn't only a problem for people: It also muddies waters and scours riverbeds, killin gthe fish, plants ,and other organisms that live there. When I was a child, we'd catch fish and snails to eat, Recalls Ha Thi Be. Since the sand dredges came, the fish and snails are no more.

## A Globle Problem

Vietnam is far from the only place where sand mining is inflicting such damage.All over the developing world, cities are growing at a furious pace, devouring sand in unprecedented quantities. The unmber of Vietnamese living in cities has double in the last twenty years, to some 32 million. Worldwide, the urban population is risin gby about 65 million people annually; that's the equivalent of adding eight New York Cites to the planet every single year. Nearly 50 billion tons of sand and gravel is extracted anually to create all the concrete office towers , apartment blocks, highways, and airports those people need. (Some Vietnamese sand is also sold to nearby Singapore, which uses gargantuan amounts to build artificial land)

Why,you might ask, don't we simply mine sand from the Sahara and other deserts? The answer is desert sand doesn't work in concrete the wind eroded grains are too smooth and rounded. As a result, from China to Jamaica, from Liberia to India,sand miners are plundering riverbeds, floodplains,and beaches for the preciou grains.
